		<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
		<p>By downloading and using Campfire, these terms will automatically apply to you, therefore you should make sure that you read them carefully.</p>
		<p>This application is provided to you by Pandula Péter at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
		<h2>Intended usage</h2>
		<p>The aim of the application is to help musicians learn new songs and expand their knowledge.</p>
		<p>Please keep in mind that performing cover versions of copyrighted works publicly, without getting permission from the original artist or the copyright holder can be considered infringement. Any possible legal and / or financial repercussions resulting from disregarding this fact is your responsability as the Campfire application does not encourage copyright infringement in any way.</p>
		<h2>Working conditions</h2>
		<p>You should be aware that certain functions of the app will require an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but I cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
		<p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that I assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
		<p>Along the same lines, I cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the service, I cannot accept responsibility.</p>
		<p>With respect to my responsibility for your use of the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although I endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, I accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of Campfire.</p>
		<h2>Long-term support</h2>
		<p>At some point, I may wish to update the app. Campfire is currently available on Android, supporting devices on API level 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop) and bove. The requirements for this system (and for any additional systems I decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. I cannot promise that I will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and / or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.</p>
		<p>I may also wish to stop providing the app for reasons I am not obliged to disclose, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless I tell you otherwise, upon any termination, the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end and you must stop using the application and delete it from your device.</p>
		<p>I am committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. I will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
		<h2>Source code</h2>
		<p>You are not allowed to copy or modify the application, or any large part of it, in any way. You are not allowed to make derivative versions, even though the source code is publicly available online. You are permitted to take inspiration from certain technical solutions, but pieces of software resulting from my work can only be used in non-competing applications. The app itself and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to me.</p>
		<h2>Changes to this Terms and Conditions</h2>
		<p> I may update my Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>
		<h2>Contact me</h2>
		<p>If you have any questions or suggestions about my Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:pandulapeter@gmail.com?Subject=Campfire" target="_top">contact me</a>.</p>
