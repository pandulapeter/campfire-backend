# Campfire (backend)
*Explore a handpicked library of high quality song lyrics and chords.*

Campfire is a companion app for musicians and people who like to sing. It contains a small, but growing number of songs and song collections as well as useful features such as transposing the key signature, auto-scroll or the ability to create and share your own playlists.

The app follows the latest Material design guidelines, featuring beautiful animations and supporting both light and dark themes. 

Campfire is completely free, without any ads.

### Pull requests
If you'd like to help me by adding more songs to the database, please message me at <pandulapeter@gmail.com> first. I have a long list of songs that I'm planning to add and I also have some standards for the file formatting that are not documented yet.
