{V_1}
I could [D]stay awake [A/C#]just to hear you [Bm7]breathing,
Watch you [G]smile while you are [D/F#]sleeping,
While you're [Em7]far away dreaming.
I could [D]spend my life [A/C#]in this sweet sur[Bm7]render,
I could [G]stay lost in this [D/F#]moment for[Em7]ever,
Every moment [F#m]spent with [G]you is a moment I [A7]treasure.

{C}
[D]Don't want to [A/C#]close my eyes,
[Em7]I don't want to fall asleep,
'Cause I'd [G]miss you baby,
And I don't want to [A]miss a thing.
[D]'Cause even when I [A/C#]dream of you,
[Em7]The sweetest dream will never do,
I'd still [G]miss you baby,
And I don't want to [A]miss a thing.
[D]      [A/C#]    [Em7]

{V_2}
Lying [D]close to you, [A/C#]feeling your heart [Bm7]beating,
And I'm [G]wondering what you're [D/F#]dreaming,
Wondering [Em7]if it's me you're seeing.
Then I [D]kiss your eyes,
And [A/C#]thank God we're to[Bm7]gether,
I just want to [F#m]stay with [G]you in this moment [A7]forever, forever and ever.

I don't want to [C]miss one smile,
I don't want to [G/B]miss one kiss,
I just want to [A#]be with you,
Right here with you, [F]just like this.
I just want to [C]hold you close,
Feel your heart so [G/B]close to mine,
And just [Dm]stay here in this moment,
For all the [A7]rest of time.
[A7]Yeah!
