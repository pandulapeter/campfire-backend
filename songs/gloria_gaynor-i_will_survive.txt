{V_1}
At [Am]first I was afraid, I was [Dm]petrified,
Kept thinking [G]I could never live without you [Cmaj7]by my side,
But then I [Fmaj7]spent so many nights thinking [Bm7b5]how you did me wrong,
And I grew [Esus4]strong, and I learned [E]how to get along...

{V_2}
And so you're [Am]back from outer [Dm]space,
I just walked [G]in to find you here with that sad [Cmaj7]look upon your face.
I should have [Fmaj7]changed that stupid lock, I should have [Bm7b5]made you leave your key,
If I'd [Esus4]known for just one second you'd be [E]back to bother me.

{P}
Go on now, [Am]go, walk out the [Dm]door,
Just turn a[G]round now, 'cause you're not [Cmaj7]welcome anymore,
[Fmaj7]Weren't you the one who tried to [Bm7b5]hurt me with goodbye,
Did you think I'd [Esus4]crumble, did you think I'd [E]lay down and die?

{C}
Oh no, not [Am]I, I will sur[Dm]vive,
Oh, as [G]long as I know how to love, I [Cmaj7]know I'll stay alive,
I've got [Fmaj7]all my life to live and I've got [Bm7b5]all my love to give,
And I'll sur[Esus4]vive, I will sur[E]vive, I will survive!

[Esus4]        [E]

{V_3}
It took [Am]all the strength I had not to [Dm]fall apart,
Kept trying [G]hard to mend the pieces of my [Cmaj7]broken heart,
And I spent [Fmaj7]oh-so many nights just feeling [Bm7b5]sorry for myself,
I used to [Esus4]cry, but now I [E]hold my head up high.

{V_4}
And you see [Am]me, somebody [Dm]new,
I'm not that [G]chained-up little person still in [Cmaj7]love with you,
And so you [Fmaj7]felt like dropping in and just ex[Bm7b5]pect me to be free,
Well, now I'm [Esus4]saving all my lovin' for some[E]one who's loving me.

{P}
Go on now, [Am]go, walk out the [Dm]door,
Just turn a[G]round now, 'cause you're not [Cmaj7]welcome anymore,
[Fmaj7]Weren't you the one who tried to [Bm7b5]crush me with goodbye,
Did you think I'd [Esus4]crumble, did you think I'd [E]lay down and die?

{C}
Oh no, not [Am]I, I will sur[Dm]vive,
Oh, as [G]long as I know how to love, I [Cmaj7]know I'll stay alive,
I've got [Fmaj7]all my life to live and I've got [Bm7b5]all my love to give,
And I'll sur[Esus4]vive, [E]I will survive! [-]
