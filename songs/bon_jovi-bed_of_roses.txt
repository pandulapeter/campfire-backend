{V_1}
[A#]Sitting here wasted and wounded, at this old p[F]iano.
Trying [A#]hard to capture the moment, this morning I [F]don't know.
'Cause a [Am]bottle of vodka is still [A#]lodged in my head,
And some [F]blond gave me nightmares, I think she is still in my [A#]bed.
As I [A#]dream about movies they [C]won't make of me when I'm [F]dead.

{V_2}
With an [A#]ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the [F]morning.
While some [A#]marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're [F]talking.
About [Am]all of the things that I [A#]long to believe,
About [F]love and the truth, and what you mean to me,
And the [A#]truth is,
[A#]Baby you're [C]all that I [F]need.   [C]

{C}
I want to [Dm]lay you [C]down on a [A#]bed of [F]roses,
For to[Dm]night I [C]sleep on a [A#]bed of [F]nails.
I want to [A#]be just as [F]close as the [A#]Holy [F]Ghost is,
And [Dm]lay [C]you [A#]down on bed of [F]roses.

{V_3}
Well I'm [A#]so far away, that each step that I take is on my [F]way home.
A king's [A#]ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this [F]payphone.
Still I [Am]run out of time, or it's [A#]hard to get through,
Till the [F]bird on the wire flies me back to you,
I'll [A#]just close my eyes and whisper,
[A#]Baby [C]blind love is [F]true.   [C]

{C}
I want to [Dm]lay you [C]down on a [A#]bed of [F]roses,
For to[Dm]night I [C]sleep on a [A#]bed of [F]nails.
I want to [A#]be just as [F]close as the [A#]Holy [F]Ghost is,
And [Dm]lay [C]you [A#]down on bed of [F]roses.

{B}
Well this [A#]hotel bar hangover [C]whiskey's gone dry,
The bar[F]keeper's wig's crooked, and she's giving me the eye,
I [A#]might have said yeah,
But I [A#]laughed so hard [C]I think I [F]died.   [C]

{V_4}
When [A#]you close your eyes, know I'll be thinking a[F]bout you.
While my [A#]mistress she calls me, to stand in her spotlight [F]again.
Tonight I [A#]won't be alone, but you know that don't mean I'm not [F]lonely.
I've got [Dm]nothing to [C]prove, for it's [A#]you that I'd die to de[F]fend.   [Cx]

{C}
I want to [Dm]lay you [C]down on a [A#]bed of [F]roses,
For to[Dm]night I [C]sleep on a [A#]bed of [F]nails.
I want to [A#]be just as [F]close as the [A#]Holy [F]Ghost is,
And [Dm]lay [C]you [A#]down...   [F]    [C]

{C}
I want to [Dm]lay you [C]down on a [A#]bed of [F]roses,
For to[Dm]night I [C]sleep on a [A#]bed [F]of nails.
I want to [A#]be just as [F]close as the [A#]Holy [F]Ghost is,
And [Dm]lay [C]you [A#]down,
On bed of [F]roses.
