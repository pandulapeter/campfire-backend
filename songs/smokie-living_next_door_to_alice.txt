[A]Sally called when she got the word,
[D]And she said: \"I suppose you've heard
[E]About [A]Alice.\"   [E]
When I [A]rushed to the window and I looked outside,
[D]And I could hardly believe my eyes,
[E]As a big limousine rolled up into [A]Alice's drive.   [E]

{C}
Oh, I [A]don't know why she's leaving,
Or where she's gonna go.
I [D]guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know,
'Cause for [E]twenty-four years
I've been living next door to [A]Alice.   [E]
[A]Twenty-four years
Just waiting for a chance,
To [D]tell her how I feel,
And maybe get a second glance,
Now I've [E]got to get used to not
[D]living next door to [A]Alice.   [E]

{V_2}
We [A]grew up together, two kids in the park.
We [D]carved our initials deep in the bark
[E]Me and [A]Alice.   [E]
Now she [A]walks through the door with her head held high,
[D]Just for a moment, I caught her eye,
[E]As a big limousine pulled slowly out of [A]Alice's drive.   [E]

{C}
I [A]don't know why she's leaving,
Or where she's gonna go.
I [D]guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know,
'Cause for [E]twenty-four years
I've been living next door to [A]Alice.   [E]
[A]Twenty-four years
Just waiting for a chance,
To [D]tell her how I feel,
And maybe get a second glance,
Now I've [E]got to get used to not
[D]living next door to [A]Alice.   [E]

{V_3}
And [A]Sally called back and asked how I felt,
[D]And she said: \"I know how to help,
[E]Get over [A]Alice.\"   [E]
She said: \"Now [A]Alice is gone but I'm still here,
[D]You know I've been waiting for twenty-four years...\"
[E -]And a big limousine disappeared.

{C}
I [A]don't know why she's leaving,
Or where she's gonna go.
I [D]guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know,
'Cause for [E]twenty-four years
I've been living next door to [A]Alice.   [E]
[A]Twenty-four years
Just waiting for a chance,
To [D]tell her how I feel,
And maybe get a second glance,
Now I've [E]got to get used to not
[D]living next door to [A]Alice.

{O}
No, I'll [E]never get used to not [D]living next door to [A]Alice.
