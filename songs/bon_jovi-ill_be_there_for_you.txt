I guess this time you're really [Em]leaving,
[G]I heard your suitcase say good[D]bye.
Well as my broken heart lies [Em]bleeding,
[G]You say true love is sui[D]cide.

{V_2}
[-]You say you've cried a thousand [Em]rivers,
[G]And now you're swimming for the [D]shore.

When you get drunk, I'll be the [A]wine.

Didn't mean to miss your [G]birthday, baby,
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles [A]out.   [-]
