{V_1}
[Cm]I remember when,
I remember, I remember when I lost my [D#maj7]mind,
There was something so pleasant about that place,[G#]
Even your emotions have an echo in so much[Gsus4] space.    [G]

{V_2}
[Cm]And when you're out there, without care,
Yeah I was out of [D#maj7]touch,
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough,[G#]
I just knew too[Gsus4] much.    [G]

{C}
Does that make me [Cm]crazy?
Does that make me [D#]crazy?
Does that make me [G#]crazy?
Probab[Gsus4]ly.        [G]

{V_3}
[C]And now that you are having
The time of your [G#]life.
Well, think [D#maj7]twice,
That's my only ad[Gsus4]vice.      [G]

{V_4}
[Cm]Come on now, who do you,
Who do you, who do you,
Who do you think you [D#maj7]are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul.[G#]
You really think you're in con[Gsus4]trol?      [G]

{C}
I think you're [Cm]crazy,
I think you're [D#]crazy,
I think you're [G#]crazy,
Just like [Gsus4]me.        [G]

{V_4}
[C]My heroes had the heart,
To lose their lives out on a [G#]limb,
And all I re[D#maj7]member, is thinking,
I wanna be like[Gsus4] them.    [G]

{V_5}
[Cm]Ever since I was little,
Ever since I was little it looked like [D#maj7]fun,
And it's no coincidence I've come,[G#]
And I can die when I'm[Gsus4] done.    [G]

{C}
Maybe I'm [Cm]crazy,
Maybe you're [D#]crazy,
Maybe we're [G#]crazy,
Probab[Gsus4]ly.        [G]
