[C#]I gotta [Badd9]tell you what I'm [F#]feelin' in[C#]side,
I could [D#m]lie to my[C#]self, but it's [Badd9]true.

{V_2}
[C#]There's no de[Badd9]nying when I [F#]look in your [C#]eyes,
Girl I'm [D#m]out of my [C#]head over [Badd9]you.

{P_1}
[G#m]And I lived so [F#/A#]long believin' [B]all love is [C#]blind,
But [G#m]everything a[F#/A#]bout you is [B]tellin' me this [C#]time,

It's for[F#]ever,[C#]
[D#m]This time I [B]know and there's no [G#m7]doubt in my [C#]mind,
For[F#]ever,[C#]
[F#]Until my [G#m7]life is through,
[F#/A#]Girl I'll be [B]lovin' you for[C#]ever.[B]

{V_3}
[C#]I hear the [Badd9]echo of a [F#]promise I [C#]made,
When you're [D#m]strong you can [C#]stand on your [Badd9]own.

{V_4}
[C#]But those words grow [Badd9]distant as I [F#]look at your [C#]face,
No, I [D#m]don't want to [C#]go it a[Badd9]lone.

{P_2}
[G#m]I never [F#/A#]thought I'd lay my [B]heart on the [C#]line,
But [G#m]everything a[F#/A#]bout you is [B]tellin' me this [C#]time,

{C}
It's for[F#]ever,[C#]
[D#m]This time I [B]know and there's no [G#m7]doubt in my [C#]mind,
For[F#]ever,[C#]
[F#]Until my [G#m7]life is through,

{P_3}
[G#m]I see my [F#/A#]future when I [B]look in your [C#]eyes,
[G#m]It took your [F#/A#]love to make my [B]heart come a[C#]live,
[G#m]'Cause I lived my [F#/A#]life believin' [B]all love is [C#]blind,
