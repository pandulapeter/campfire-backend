{V_1}
I kept the [Am]right ones out,
And let the [G]wrong ones in,
Had an [C]angel of mercy
To see me through all my [F]sins.
There were [Fm/G#]times in my life,
When I was [C/G]goin' insane,
[D/F#]Tryin' to walk through
The [F]pain.

{V_2}
When I [Am]lost my grip,
And I [G]hit the floor,
Yeah, I [C]thought I could leave,
But couldn't get out the [F]door.
I was [Fm/G#]so sick and tired
Of [C/G]livin' a lie,
I was [D/F#]wishin that I
Would [F]die.

{C}
It's a[C]maz[Em]ing,
With the [F]blink of an eye
You [Em]finally see the [G]light.   [G]
It's a[C]maz[Em]ing,
When the [F]moment arrives
That you [Em]know you'll be al[G]right.   [G]
It's a[F]maz[Em]ing,
And I'm [D]sayin' a prayer
For the [G]desperate hearts to[C]night.   [C]

{V_3}
That [Am]one last shot's a
Permanent va[D]cation,
And [F]how high can you fly
With broken [C]wings?
[Am]Life's a journey,
Not a desti[D]nation,
And I [F]just can't tell,
Just what tomorrow [G]brings.   [G]

{V_4}
You have to [Am]learn to crawl
Before you [G]learn to walk,
But [C]I just couldn't listen
To all that righteous [F]talk, oh yeah!
I was [Fm/G#]out on the street,
Just [C/G]tryin' to survive,
[D/F#]Scratchin' to stay
A[F]live.

{C}
It's a[C]maz[Em]ing,
With the [F]blink of an eye
You [Em]finally see the [G]light.   [G]
It's a[C]maz[Em]ing,
When the [F]moment arrives
That you [Em]know you'll be al[G]right.   [G]
It's a[F]maz[Em]ing,
And I'm [D]sayin' a prayer
For the [G]desperate hearts to[C]night.

{B}
[C]    [D]Desperate hearts, desperate hearts,
[D]    [Em]Did you wanna see without and give it out now?
[Em]    [F]Ow, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, ya-ka-kow, yeah!
