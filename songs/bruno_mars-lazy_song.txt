Don't [B]feel like picking [F#]up my phone,
So [E]leave a message at the tone,
'Cause to[B]day I swear I'm [D#7]not doing [E]anything.

{V_1}
Uh, I'm gonna [B]kick my feet up and [F#]stare at the fan,
Turn the [E]TV on, throw my hand in my pants.
[B]Nobody's gon' [F#]tell me I [E]can't, no.

{V_2}
I'll be [B]loungin' on the couch, just [F#]chillin' in my snuggie,
Flip to [E]MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie,
'Cause [B]in my castle [F#]I'm the freakin' [E]man.
