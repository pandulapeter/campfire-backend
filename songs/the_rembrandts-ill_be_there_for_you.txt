[A]So no one told you life was
[Asus2]Fonna be this [G]way.
[A]Your job's a joke, you're broke,
Your love life's D.O.[C#m]A.
[D]It's like you're [Bm]always stuck in [A]second gear,
When it [D]hasn't been your [A]day, your week, your [Hm]month,
Or even your [E]year, but...

{C}
[A]I'll be [D]there for [E]you,
(When the [E7]rain starts to [A]pour)
I'll be [D]there for [E]you,
(Just like I've [E7]been there be[A]fore)
I'll be [D]there for [E]you,
'Cause you're [E7]there for me [G]too.

{V_2}
[A]You're still in bed at ten,
And [Asus2]work began at [D]eight.
[A]You've burned your breakfast, so far
Things are going [C#m]great.
[D]Your mother [Bm]warned you there'd be [A]days like these.
But she [D]didn't tell you [A]when the world [Bm]has brought 
You down to your [E]knees and...

{C}
[A]I'll be [D]there for [E]you,
(When the [E7]rain starts to [A]pour)
I'll be [D]there for [E]you,
(Just like I've [E7]been there be[A]fore)
I'll be [D]there for [E]you,
'Cause you're [E7]there for me [G]too.

{B_1}
[D]No one could ever know me,
[D]No one could ever see me,
[F#m]Seems you're the only one who knows
What it's like to be me.
[Bm]Someone to face the day with,
[A]Make it through all the rest with,
[G]Someone I'll [F#m]always laugh with,
[D]Even at my [E]worst, I'm best with [F#m]you, [E]yeah.

Or even your [E]year...

I'll be [D]there for [E]you,
'Cause you're [E7]there for me [G]too.

[A]I'll be [D]there for [E]you,   [E7]
[A]I'll be [D]there for [E]you,
'Cause you're [E7]there for me [G]too.
