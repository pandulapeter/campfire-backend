[G]Almost Heaven,[G/F#m]
[Em]West Virginia,
[D]Blue Ridge Mountains, [C]Shenandoah [G]River.
[G]Life is old [G/F#m]there,
[Em]Older than the trees,
[D]Younger than the mountains, [C]growin' like a [G]breeze.

{C}
Country [G]roads, take me [D]home,
To the [Em]place I be[C]long:
West Vir[G]ginia, mountain [D]momma,
Take me [C]home,[C/B]    [Am]
Country [G]roads.

[G]All my memories,[G/F#m]
[Em]Gather round her,
[D]Modest lady, [C]stranger to blue [G]water.
[G]Dark and dusty,[G/F#m]
[Em]Painted on the sky,
[D]Misty taste of moonshine, [C]teardrop in my [G]eye.

{C}
Country [G]roads, take me [D]home,
To the [Em]place I be[C]long:
West Vir[G]ginia, mountain [D]momma,
Take me [C]home,[C/B]    [Am]
Country [G]roads.

[Em]I hear her [D]voice, in the [G]mornin' hours she calls me,
The [C]radio re[G]minds me of my [D]home far away.
And [Em]drivin' down the [D]road,
I get a [C]feelin' that I [G]should have been home
[D]Yesterday, yester[D7]day.

{C}
Country [G]roads, take me [D]home,
To the [Em]place I be[C]long:
West Vir[G]ginia, mountain [D]momma,
Take me [C]home,[C/B]    [Am]
Country [G]roads.
