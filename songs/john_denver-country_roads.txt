{V_1}
[A]Almost Heaven,[E/G#]
[F#m]West Virginia,
[E]Blue Ridge Mountains, [D]Shenandoah [A]River.
[A]Life is old [E/G#]there,
[F#m]Older than the trees,
[E]Younger than the mountains, [D]growin' like a [A]breeze.

{C}
Country [A]roads, take me [E]home,
To the [F#m]place I be[D]long:
West Vir[A]ginia, mountain [E]momma,
Take me [D]home,[D/C#]    [Bm]
Country [A]roads.

{V_2}
[A]All my memories,[E/G#]
[F#m]Gather round her,
[E]Modest lady, [D]stranger to blue [A]water.
[A]Dark and dusty,[E/G#]
[F#m]Painted on the sky,
[E]Misty taste of moonshine, [D]teardrop in my [A]eye.

{C}
Country [A]roads, take me [E]home,
To the [F#m]place I be[D]long:
West Vir[A]ginia, mountain [E]momma,
Take me [D]home,[D/C#]    [Bm]
Country [A]roads.

{B}
[F#m]I hear her [E]voice, in the [A]mornin' hours she calls me,
The [D]radio re[A]minds me of my [E]home far away.
And [F#m]drivin' down the [E]road,
I get a [D]feelin' that I [A]should have been home
[E]Yesterday, yester[E7]day.

{C}
Country [A]roads, take me [E]home,
To the [F#m]place I be[D]long:
West Vir[A]ginia, mountain [E]momma,
Take me [D]home,[D/C#]    [Bm]
Country [A]roads.
