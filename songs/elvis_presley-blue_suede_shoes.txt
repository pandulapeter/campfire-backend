{V_1}
Well, it's one for the money,
Two for the show,
Three to get ready,
Now go, cat, go!

{C}
But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything,
But stay off of my blue suede shoes!

{V_2}
Well, you can knock me down,
Step in my face,
Slander my name all over the place.
Well, do anything that you want to do,
But uh-uh, honey lay off of them shoes.

{C}
And don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything,
But stay off of my blue suede shoes!

{S_1}
Let's go, cat!
Ah, walk the dog.

{V_3}
You can burn my house,
Steal my car.
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar.
Well do anything that you want to do,
But uh-uh, honey lay off of my shoes.

{C}
And don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything,
But stay off of my blue suede shoes.

{S_2}
Rock it!
Yeah!

{V_1}
Well, it's one for the money,
Two for the show,
Three to get ready,
Now go, go, go!

{C}
But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything,
But stay off of my blue suede shoes!

{O}
Well, it's
Blue, blue,
Blue suede shoes.
Blue, blue,
Blue suede shoes, yeah!
Blue, blue,
Blue, suede shoes, baby.
Blue, blue,
Blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything,
But stay off of my blue suede shoes!
