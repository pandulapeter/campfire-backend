I see you comb your [C]hair and [F]give me that [G]grin,
It's [F]making me [C]spin now, [F]spinnin' with[G]in,
Before I [F]melt like [C]snow,
[F]I say \"He[G]llo, [F]how do you [C]do!\"   [F]    [G]

{V_2}
I love the way you un[C]dress now, [F]baby beg[G]in,
[F]Do your ca[C]ress, honey, my [F]heart's in a [G]mess,
I love your [F]blue-eyed [C]voice, like Tiny [F]Tim shines [G]through,
[F]How do you [C]do! ([F]how do you [G]do)

{P_1}
Well here we [Am]are, cracking jokes in the [G]corner of our mouths,
And I [F]feel like I'm laughing in a [C]dream.
If I was [Am]young I could wait outside your [G]school,
'Cause your face is like the cover of a [F]magazine.   [G]

{C}
How do you [D#]do, do you do, the [A#]things that you do,
No one I [D#]know could [G#]ever keep [A#]up with you,
How do you [Cm]do, did it [G#]ever make [A#]sense to you,
To say [Cm]bye, [G#]bye, [A#]bye.

{V_3}
I see you in that [C]chair with [F]perfect [G]skin,
Well [F]how have you [C]been baby, [F]livin' in [G]sin?
Hey, [F]I gotta [C]know, did [F]you say hel[G]lo,
[F]How do you [C]do! ([F]how do you [G]do)

{P_2}
Well here we [Am]are, spending time, in the [G]louder part of town,
And it [F]feels like everything's sur[C]real.
When I get [Am]old I will wait outside your [G]house,
'Cause your hands have got the power [F]meant to heal.   [G]

{C}
How do you [D#]do, do you do, the [A#]things that you do,
No one I [D#]know could [G#]ever keep [A#]up with you,
How do you [Cm]do, did it [G#]ever make [A#]sense to you,
To say [Cm]bye, [G#]bye, [A#]bye.

How do you [F]do, do you do, the [C]things that you do,
No one I [F]know could [A#]ever keep [C]up with you,
How do you [Dm]do, did it [A#]ever make [C]sense to you,
To say [Dm]bye, [A#]bye, [C]bye.

{C}
Oh, how do you [F]do, do you do, the [C]things that you do,

How do you [Dm]do, did it [A#]ever make [C]sense to you,
To say [Dm]bye, [A#]bye, [C]bye.

{C}
Yeah, how do you [F]do, do you do, the [C]things that you do,
No one I [F]know could [A#]ever keep [C]up with you,
How do you [Dm]do, did it [A#]ever make [C]sense to you,
To say [Dm]bye, [A#]bye, [C]bye.
