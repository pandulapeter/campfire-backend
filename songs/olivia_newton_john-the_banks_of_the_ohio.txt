{V_1}
I asked my [C]love to take a [G]walk,
To take a [G7]walk, just a little [C]walk.
Down be[C7]side where the waters [F]flow,   [Fm]
Down by the [C]banks[G7] of the Ohi[C]o.

{C}
And only [C]say that you'll be [G]mine,
In no [G7]others' arms ent[C]wine.
Down be[C7]side where the waters [F]flow,   [Fm]
Down by the [C]banks[G7] of the Ohi[C]o.

{V_2}
I held a [C]knife against his [G]breast,
As into [G7]my arms he [C]pressed.
He cried \"My [C7]love, don't you murder [F]me,   [Fm]
I'm not pre[C]pared[G7] for eterni[C]ty.\"

{C}
And only [C]say that you'll be [G]mine,
In no [G7]others' arms ent[C]wine.
Down be[C7]side where the waters [F]flow,   [Fm]
Down by the [C]banks[G7] of the Ohi[C]o.

{V_3}
I wandered [C]home 'tween twelve and [G]one.
I cried, \"My [G7]God, what have I [C]done?\"
I've killed the [C7]only man I [F]loved,   [Fm]
He would not [C]take me [G7]for his [C]bride.

{C}
And only [C]say that you'll be [G]mine,
In no [G7]others' arms ent[C]wine.
Down be[C7]side where the waters [F]flow,   [Fm]
Down by the [C]banks[G7] of the Ohi[C]o.
