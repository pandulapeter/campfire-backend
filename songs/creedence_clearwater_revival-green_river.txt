Well, [E]take me back down where cool water flow, yeah,
[E]Let me remember things I love.
[E]Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite,
[C]Walkin' along the river road at night,
[A]Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight.   [E]

{V_2}
[E]I can hear the bull frog callin' me,
[E]Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree.
[E]Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water,
[C]Shoe fly, dragon fly, get back to your mother,
[A]Pick up a flat rock, skip it across Green [E]River.

[E]Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, oh,
With [E]flat car riders and cross-tie walkers.

An' [A]if you get lost come on home to Green [E]River.

{O}
[E]Well...
