[F#m]Rainy night and we worked all day,
We [D]both got jobs 'cause there's bills to pay,
[E]We got something they can't take away,
[Asus4]Our love, [A]
[Asus4]Our lives. [A]

{V_2}
[F#m]Close the door, leave the cold outside,
I [D]don't need nothing when I'm by your side,
[E]We got something that'll never die,
[Asus4]Our dreams, [A]
[Asus4]Our pride. [A]

{P_1}
My heart [F]beats like a drum ([G]all [Am]night),
Flesh to [F]flesh, one to one (and it's[G] alr[Am]ight),
And I'll [F]never let go,
'Cause there's [Am]something I know deep in[E]side.

{C}
You were [Am]born to be my [F]baby,
And baby, I was [G]made to be your [C]man.
[G]We got [Am]something to be[F]lieve in,
Even if we [G]don't know where we [Am]stand.
Only [F]God would know the [C]reasons,
But I bet he [Am]must have had a [G]plan.
'Cause you were [Am]born to be my [F]baby,
And baby, I was [G]made to be your [Am]man.

{V_3}
[F#m]Light a candle, blow the world away,
[D]Table for two on a TV tray,
[E]It ain't fancy, baby that's OK,
[Asus4]Our time, [A]
[Asus4]Our way. [A]

{V_4}
So [F#m]hold me close, better hang on tight,
[D]Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride,
We're [E]two kids hitching down the road of life,
[Asus4]Our world, [A]
[Asus4]Our fight. [A]

{P_2}
If we [F]stand side by side ([G]all [Am]night),
There's a [F]chance we'll get by (and it's[G] alr[Am]ight),
And I'll [F]know that you'll live
In my [Am]heart till the day that I [E]die.

{C}
You were [Am]born to be my [F]baby,
