[D#]Where is the [G#]moment when we need it the [A#]most?
[D#]You kick up the [G#]leaves and the magic is [A#]lost.
[Cm]They tell me your [A#]blue skies fade to [G#]grey,
They tell me your [D#]passion's gone a[Fm7]way,
And I don't need no carryin’ [A#]on.

{V_2}
[D#]You stand in the [G#]line just to hit a new [A#]low,
[D#]You're faking a [G#]smile with the coffee you [A#]go,
[Cm]You tell me your [A#]life's been way off [G#]line,
You're falling to [D#]pieces every [Fm7]time,
And I don't need no carryin' [A#]on.

{C}
‘Cause you had a bad [D#]day, you're taking one [G#]down,
You sing a sad [Fm7]song just to turn it a[A#]round.
You say you don't [D#]know, you tell me, don't [G#]lie,
You work on a [Fm7]smile and you go for a [A#]ride.
You had a bad [Cm]day, the camera don't [A#]lie,
You're coming back [G#]down and you really don't [D#]mind,
You had a bad [Fm7]day,   [A#]
You had a bad day.

{B_2}
[Cm]Well you need a [A#]blue sky holi[G#]day,
The point is they [D#]laugh at what you [Fm7]say,
And I don't need no carryin' [A#]on.

You had a bad [D#]day, you're taking one [G#]down,
You sing a sad [Fm7]song just to turn it a[A#]round.
You say you don't [D#]know, you tell me, don't [G#]lie,
You work on a [Fm7]smile and you go for a [A#]ride.
You had a bad [Cm]day, the camera don't [A#]lie,
You're coming back [G#]down and you really don't [D#]mind,
You had a bad [Fm7]day.   [A#]
You had a bad [D#]day.

{B_3}
[A#]Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the [D#]whole thing it turns out wrong.
You [A#]might not make it back and you know that
You could [D#]be well oh that strong,
Well I'm not [F]wrong.

{B_4}
[D#]So where is the [G#]passion when you need it the [A#]most?
[D#]You kick up the [G#]leaves and the magic is [A#]lost.

‘Cause  you had a bad [D#]day, you're taking one [G#]down,
You sing a sad [Fm7]song just to turn it a[A#]round.
You say you don't [D#]know, you tell me, don't [G#]lie,
You work on a [Fm7]smile and you go for a [A#]ride.
You had a bad [Cm]day, you've seen what you [A#]like,
And how does it [G#]feel for one more [D#]time,
You had a bad [Fm7]day,   [A#]
You had a bad day.
