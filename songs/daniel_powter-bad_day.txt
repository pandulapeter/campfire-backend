[A#]Where is the [D#]moment when we need it the [F]most?
[A#]You kick up the [D#]leaves and the magic is [F]lost.
[Gm]They tell me your [F]blue skies fade to [D#]grey,
They tell me your [A#]passion's gone a[Cm7]way,
And I don't need no carryin’ [F]on.

{V_2}
[A#]You stand in the [D#]line just to hit a new [F]low,
[A#]You're faking a [D#]smile with the coffee you [F]go,
[Gm]You tell me your [F]life's been way off [D#]line,
You're falling to [A#]pieces every [Cm7]time,
And I don't need no carryin' [F]on.

{C}
‘Cause you had a bad [A#]day, you're taking one [D#]down,
You sing a sad [Cm7]song just to turn it a[F]round.
You say you don't [A#]know, you tell me, don't [D#]lie,
You work on a [Cm7]smile and you go for a [F]ride.
You had a bad [Gm]day, the camera don't [F]lie,
You're coming back [D#]down and you really don't [A#]mind,
You had a bad [Cm7]day,   [F]
You had a bad day.

{B_2}
[Gm]Well you need a [F]blue sky holi[D#]day,
The point is they [A#]laugh at what you [Cm7]say,
And I don't need no carryin' [F]on.

{C}
You had a bad [A#]day, you're taking one [D#]down,
You sing a sad [Cm7]song just to turn it a[F]round.
You say you don't [A#]know, you tell me, don't [D#]lie,
You work on a [Cm7]smile and you go for a [F]ride.
You had a bad [Gm]day, the camera don't [F]lie,
You're coming back [D#]down and you really don't [A#]mind,
You had a bad [Cm7]day.   [F]
You had a bad [A#]day.

{B_3}
[F]Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the [A#]whole thing it turns out wrong.
You [F]might not make it back and you know that
You could [A#]be well oh that strong,
Well I'm not [C]wrong.

{B_4}
[A#]So where is the [D#]passion when you need it the [F]most?
[A#]You kick up the [D#]leaves and the magic is [F]lost.

‘Cause  you had a bad [A#]day, you're taking one [D#]down,
You sing a sad [Cm7]song just to turn it a[F]round.
You say you don't [A#]know, you tell me, don't [D#]lie,
You work on a [Cm7]smile and you go for a [F]ride.
You had a bad [Gm]day, you've seen what you [F]like,
And how does it [D#]feel for one more [A#]time,
You had a bad [Cm7]day,   [F]
You had a bad day.
