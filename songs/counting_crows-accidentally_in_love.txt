[G]So she said what's the [C]problem baby?
[G]What's the problem, I don't [C]know,
Well maybe I'm in [Em]love (love!)
Think about, it [A]every time I think about it,

{V_2}
[G]How much longer will it [C]take to cure this?

That's coming all this [Em]love,
Melting under [A]blue skies,
Belting out [C]sunlight, shimmering [G]love.

Well baby [C]I surrender
To the [G]strawberry ice cream,
