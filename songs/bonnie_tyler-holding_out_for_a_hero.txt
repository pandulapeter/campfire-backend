[Am]Where have all the good men gone,
And [G]where are all the gods?
[F]Where's the streetwise Hercules,
To [E]fight the rising odds?
[Am]Isn't there a white knight,
U[Em]pon a fiery steed?
[Dm]Late at night I toss and I turn,
And I [Esus4]dream of what I [E]need.

{C}
I need a [Am]hero.
I'm holding out for a
[Em]Hero 'til the end of the night.
He's [F]gotta be strong,
And he's gotta be fast,
And he's [C]gotta be fresh from the [G]fight.
I need a [Am]hero.
I'm holding out for a
[Em]Hero 'til the morning light.
He's [F]gotta be sure,
And it's gotta be soon,
And he's [C]gotta be larger than [G]life.

Larger than [Am]life.   [Am7/G]

{V_2}
[Am]Somewhere after midnight,
In my [G]wildest fantasy,
[F]Somewhere just beyond my reach,
There's [E]someone reaching back for me.
[Am]Racing on the thunder,
And [Em]rising with the heat.
[Dm]It's gonna take a superman
To [Esus4]sweep me off my [E]feet.   [E7]

[Am]Up where the mountains meet the heavens above,
[F]Out where the lightning splits the sea,
[Dm]I could swear there is [E]someone, somewhere,
[Am]Watching me.
[Am]Through the wind, and the chill, and the rain,
[F]And the storm, and the flood,
[Dm]I can feel his app[E]roach like a fire in my [Am]blood.
