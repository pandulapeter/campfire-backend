{V_1}
[Bm]On a dark desert highway, [F#7]cool wind in my hair,
[A]Warm smell of colitas, [E]rising up through the air,
[G]Up ahead in the distance, [D]I saw a shimmering light,
[Em]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, [F#]I had to stop for the night.

{V_2}
[Bm]There she stood in the doorway, [F#7]I heard the mission bell,
[A]And I was thinking to myself, this could be [E]heaven or this could be hell.
[G]Then she lit up a candle [D]and she showed me the way,
[Em]There were voices down the corridor, [F#]I thought I heard them say.

{C}
[G]Welcome to the Hotel Cali[D]fornia,
Such a [F#7]lovely place (such a lovely place),
Such a [Bm]lovely face.
[G]Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[D]fornia,
Any [Em]time of year (any time of year),
You can [F#]find it here.

{V_3}
[Bm]Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, [F#7]she got the Mercedes bends,
[A]She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, [E]that she calls friends.
[G]How they dance in the courtyard, [D]sweet summer sweat,
[Em]Some dance to remember, [F#]some dance to forget.

{V_4}
[Bm]So I called up the Captain, \"[F#7]Please bring me my wine,\"
He said, \"[A]we haven't had that spirit here since [E]nineteen sixty-nine,\"
[G]And still those voices are calling from [D]far away,
[Em]Wake you up in the middle of the night, [F#]just to hear them say:

{C}
[G]Welcome to the Hotel Cali[D]fornia,
Such a [F#7]lovely place (such a lovely place),
Such a [Bm]lovely face.
They [G]livin' it up at the Hotel Cali[D]fornia,
What a [Em]nice surprise (what a nice surprise),
Bring your [F#]alibis.

{V_5}
[Bm]Mirrors on the ceiling, [F#7]the pink champagne on ice,
And she said, \"[A]We are all just prisoners here, [E]of our own device.\"
[G]And in the master's chambers, [D]they gathered for the feast,
[Em]They stab it with their steely knives, but they [F#]just can't kill the beast.

{V_6}
[Bm]Last thing I remember, I was [F#7]running for the door,
[A]I had to find the passage back to the [E]place I was before,
\"[G]Relax,\" said the night man, \"We are [D]programmed to receive.
[Em]You can check out any time you like, [F#]but you can never leave!\"
