She says, we've got to [C]hold [D]on to what we've [Em]got,
It [C]doesn't make a [D]difference if we make it or [Em]not,
We've [C]got each [D]other and that's a [Em]lot for [C]love,
We'll [D]give it a shot.

[Em]Gina dreams of running away,
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
Baby, it's [C]okay,   [D]
Some[Em]day.

We've got to [C]hold [D]on to what we've [Em]got,
It [C]doesn't make a [D]difference if we make it or [Em]not,
We've [C]got each [D]other and that's a [Em]lot for [C]love,
We'll [D]give it a shot.
