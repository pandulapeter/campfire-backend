{V_1}
I spent [G]twenty years trying to get [C]out of this place,
I was [Am]looking for something I [C]couldn't replace.
I was [G]running away from the [C]only thing I've [D]ever known.

{V_2}
Like a [G]blind dog with[C]out a bone,
I was a [Am]gypsy lost in the [C]twilight zone.
I [G]hijacked a rainbow and [C]crashed into a [D]pot of gold.

{P_1}
[Em]I've been there, done [C]that, I ain't looking [G]back on the seeds I've sown,
Saving [Bm]dimes, spending [C]too much time on the [D]telephone...
Who says you can't go [G]home?

{C}
Who says you [C]can't go home?
There's [Am]only one place they call me [C]one of their own.
Just a [G]hometown boy [C]born a rolling [D]stone,
Who says you can't go [G]home?
Who says you [C]can't go back?
Been [Am]all around the world and as a [C]matter of fact,
There's [G]only one place [C]left I wanna [D]go,
Who says you can't go [G]home?

{B_1}
It's alright, it's alright, [C]it's alright, it's alright, [Am]it's alright!   [C]

{V_3}
I went as [G]far as I could, I tried to [C]find a new face,
There isn't [Am]one of these lines that [C]I would erase,
I lived a [G]million miles of [C]memories on that [D]road.

{V_2}
With every [G]step I take, I know that [C]I'm not alone,
You take the [Am]home from the boy, but not the [C]boy from his home.
[G]These are my streets, the [C]only life I've [D]ever known.
Who says you can't go [G]home?

{B_2}
It's alright, it's alright, [C]it's alright, it's alright, [Am]it's alright!   [C]
Who says you can't go [G]home?
It's alright, it's alright, [C]it's alright, it's alright, [Am]it's alright!   [C]

{P_2}
[Em]I've been there, done [C]that, I ain't looking [G]back, it's been a long-long road.
Feels [Bm]like I've never [C]left, that's how the [D]story goes...

{B_3}
It doesn't [G]matter where you are,
It doesn't [C]matter where you go,
If it's a [Am]million miles away or just a [C]mile up the road,
Take it [G]in,
Take it [C]with you when you [D]go.
Who says you can't go [G]home?

{C}
Who says you [C]can't go home?
There's [Am]only one place they call me [C]one of their own.
