{V_1}
[G]Woke up to the sound of [Cadd9]pouring rain,
[G]The wind would whisper and I'd [Cadd9]think of you.
[G]And all the tears you cried, that [Cadd9]called my name,
[D]And when you needed me [C]I came through.

{V_2}
[G]I paint a picture of the [Cadd9]days gone by,
[G]When love went blind and you would [Cadd9]make me see.
[G]I'd stare a lifetime in[Cadd9]to your eyes,
[D]So that I knew that you were [C]there for me,
[D]Time after time you were [C]there for me.

[G]Remember yesterday, [D]walking hand in hand,

[Em]I'd want to hear you say, [C]I remember you.

[G]We spent the summer with the [Cadd9]top rolled down,
[G]Wished ever after would [Cadd9]be like this.
[G]You said I love you babe, wi[Cadd9]thout a sound,
[D]I said I'd give my life for [C]just one kiss,
[D]I'd live for your smile and [C]die for your kiss.

{B}
[C]We've had our share of hard times,

[G]Woke up to the sound of [Cadd9]pouring rain,
[G]Washed away a [Cadd9]dream of you.
[G]But nothing else could ever [Cadd9]take you away,
[D]'Cause you'll always be my [C]dream come true,
[D]Oh my darling, [C]I love you!
