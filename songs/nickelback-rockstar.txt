{V_1}
I'm through with [G]standin' in lines to clubs I'll never get in,
It's like the [C]bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win,
This [F]life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to [G]be.
(Tell me what you want)

{V_2}
I want a [G]brand new house on an episode of Cribs,
And a [C]bathroom I can play baseball in,
And a [F]king size tub, big enough for ten plus [G]me.
(Yeah, so what you need?)

{V_3}
I need a [G]credit card that's got no limit,
And a [C]big black jet with a bedroom in it,
Gonna [F]join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand [G]feet.
(Been there, done that)

{V_4}
I want a [G]new tour bus full of old guitars,
My own [C]star on Hollywood Boulevard,
Some[F]where between Cher and James Dean is fine for [G]me.
(So how you gonna do it?)

{B_1}
I'm gonna [A#]trade this life for fortune and fame,
I'd even [C]cut my hair and change my name.

{C}
'Cause we [G]all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in [A#]hilltop houses, drivin' fifteen cars.
The [C]girls come easy and the drugs come cheap,
We'll [D#]all stay skinny 'cause we [F]just won't eat,
And we'll [G]hang out in the coolest bars,
In the [A#]VIP with the movie stars,
Every [C]good gold digger's gonna wind up there,
Every [D#]Playboy bunny with her [F]bleach blond hair,
And well, [A#]hey, [C]hey, I wanna be a rock[G]star.
[A#]Hey, [C]hey, I wanna be a rock[G]star.

{V_4}
I wanna be [G]great like Elvis without the tassels,
Hire [C]eight body guards that love to beat up assholes,
Sign a [F]couple autographs so I can eat my meals for [G]free.
(I'll have the quesadilla, ha, ha)

{V_5}
I'm gonna [G]dress my ass with the latest fashion,
Get a [C]front door key to the Playboy mansion,
Gonna [F]date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for [G]me.
(So how you gonna do it?)

Every [D#]Playboy bunny with her [F]bleach blond hair,
And we'll [G]hide out in the private rooms,
With the [A#]latest dictionary of today's who's who,
They'll [C]get you anything with that evil smile,
Every[D#]body's got a drug dealer [F]on speed dial.
Well, [A#]hey, [C]hey, I wanna be a rock[G]star.

{B_2}
I'm gonna [D#]sing those songs that offend the censors,
Gonna [A#]pop my pills from a Pez dispenser.
Get [D#]washed-up singers writin' all my songs,
Lip[C]sync 'em every night so I don't [F]get 'em wrong.
