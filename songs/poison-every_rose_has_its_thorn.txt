{V_1}
[G]We both lie silently still
In the [Cadd9]dead of the night.
Although we [G]both lie close together,
We feel [Cadd9]miles apart inside.
Was it [G]something I said or [Cadd9]something I did?
Did my [G]words not come out [Cadd9]right?
Though I [D]tried not to hurt you,
Though I [C]tried,
But I guess that's why they say

{C}
[G]Every rose has its [Cadd9]thorn,
Just like [G]every night has its [Cadd9]dawn,
Just like [G]every [D]cowboy sings a [C]sad, sad [G]song,
[G]Every rose has its [C]thorn.

{V_2}
I [G]listen to our favorite song
Playing on the [Cadd9]radio.
Hear the [G]DJ say love's a game of easy come and
[Cadd9]Easy go.
But I [G]wonder does [Cadd9]he know?
Has he [G]ever felt like [Cadd9]this?
And I [D]know that you'd be here right now
If I [C]could have let you know somehow, I guess

{C}
[G]Every rose has its [Cadd9]thorn,
Just like [G]every night has its [Cadd9]dawn,
Just like [G]every [D]cowboy sings a [C]sad, sad [G]song,
[G]Every rose has its [C]thorn.

{B}
[Em]Though it's been a [D]while now,
I can [C]still feel so much [G]pain.
[Em]Like a knife that [D]cuts you, the wound heals,
[C]But the scar, that scar remains.

{V_3}
[G]I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'[Cadd9]d known what to say.
In[G]stead of makin' love,
We both [Cadd9]made our separate ways.
And now I [G]hear you found some[Cadd9]body new,
And that I [G]never meant that [Cadd9]much to you.
To [D]hear that tears me up inside,
And to [C]see you cuts me like a knife, I guess

{C}
[G]Every rose has its [Cadd9]thorn,
Just like [G]every night has its [Cadd9]dawn,
Just like [G]every [D]cowboy sings a [C]sad, sad [G]song,
[G]Every rose has its [C]thorn.
