{V_1}
[F#]We both lie silently still
In the [Badd9]dead of the night.
Although we [F#]both lie close together,
We feel [Badd9]miles apart inside.
Was it [F#]something I said or [Badd9]something I did?
Did my [F#]words not come out [Badd9]right?
Though I [C#]tried not to hurt you,
Though I [B]tried,
But I guess that's why they say

{C}
[F#]Every rose has its [Badd9]thorn,
Just like [F#]every night has its [Badd9]dawn,
Just like [F#]every [C#]cowboy sings a [B]sad, sad [F#]song,
[F#]Every rose has its [B]thorn.

{V_2}
I [F#]listen to our favorite song
Playing on the [Badd9]radio.
Hear the [F#]DJ say love's a game of easy come and
[Badd9]Easy go.
But I [F#]wonder does [Badd9]he know?
Has he [F#]ever felt like [Badd9]this?
And I [C#]know that you'd be here right now
If I [B]could have let you know somehow, I guess

{C}
[F#]Every rose has its [Badd9]thorn,
Just like [F#]every night has its [Badd9]dawn,
Just like [F#]every [C#]cowboy sings a [B]sad, sad [F#]song,
[F#]Every rose has its [B]thorn.

{B}
[D#m]Though it's been a [C#]while now,
I can [B]still feel so much [F#]pain.
[D#m]Like a knife that [C#]cuts you, the wound heals,
[B]But the scar, that scar remains.

{V_3}
[F#]I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'[Badd9]d known what to say.
In[F#]stead of makin' love,
We both [Badd9]made our separate ways.
And now I [F#]hear you found some[Badd9]body new,
And that I [F#]never meant that [Badd9]much to you.
To [C#]hear that tears me up inside,
And to [B]see you cuts me like a knife, I guess

{C}
[F#]Every rose has its [Badd9]thorn,
Just like [F#]every night has its [Badd9]dawn,
Just like [F#]every [C#]cowboy sings a [B]sad, sad [F#]song,
[F#]Every rose has its [B]thorn.
