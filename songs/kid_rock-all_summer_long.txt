It was[D] 1989,[C] my thoughts were [G]short my hair was long,
[D]Caught somewhere bet[C]ween a boy and [G]man.
[D]She was seven[C]teen and she was [G]far from in-between,
It was [D]summertime in [C]Northern [G]Michigan.

{V_2}
[D]Splashing through the [C]sand bar, [G]talking by the campfire,
It's the [D]simple things in [C]life, like when and [G]where.
We [D]didn't have no [C]internet, but [G]man, I never will forget.
The [D]way the moonlight [C]shined upon her [G]hair.

{C}
And we were [D]trying different [C]things, we were [G]smoking funny things,
Making [D]love out by the [C]lake to our favorite [G]song.
Sipping [D]whiskey out the [C]bottle, not [G]thinking 'bout tomorrow,
Singing [D]Sweet Home Ala[C]bama all [G]summer long.
[D]    [C]    [G]
Singing [D]Sweet Home Ala[C]bama all [G]summer long.

{V_3}
Catching [D]Walleye from the [C]dock, watching the [G]waves roll off the rocks,
She'll for[D]ever hold a [C]spot inside my [G]soul.
We'd [D]blister in the [C]sun, we couldn't [G]wait for night to come,
To [D]hit that sand and [C]play some rock and [G]roll!

{C}
While we were [D]trying different [C]things and we were [G]smoking funny things,
Making [D]love out by the [C]lake to our favorite [G]song.
Sipping [D]whiskey out the [C]bottle, not [G]thinking 'bout tomorrow,
Singing [D]Sweet Home Ala[C]bama all [G]summer long.

{V_4}
Now [D]nothing seems as [C]strange as when the [G]leaves began to change,
Or [D]how we thought those [C]days would never [G]end.
Some[D]times I'll hear that [C]song and I'll [G]start to sing along,
And think \"[D]Man, I'd love to [C]see that girl a[G]gain\".
([G]Man, I'd love to see that girl again!)

And we were [D]trying different [C]things, we were [G]smoking funny things,
