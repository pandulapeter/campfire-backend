[A]Where is the [D]moment when we need it the [E]most?
[A]You kick up the [D]leaves and the magic is [E]lost.
[F#m]They tell me your [E]blue skies fade to [D]grey,
They tell me your [A]passion's gone a[Bm7]way,
And I don't need no carryin’ [E]on.

{V_2}
[A]You stand in the [D]line just to hit a new [E]low,
[A]You're faking a [D]smile with the coffee you [E]go,
[F#m]You tell me your [E]life's been way off [D]line,
You're falling to [A]pieces every [Bm7]time,
And I don't need no carryin' [E]on.

{C}
‘Cause you had a bad [A]day, you're taking one [D]down,
You sing a sad [Bm7]song just to turn it a[E]round.
You say you don't [A]know, you tell me, don't [D]lie,
You work on a [Bm7]smile and you go for a [E]ride.
You had a bad [F#m]day, the camera don't [E]lie,
You're coming back [D]down and you really don't [A]mind,
You had a bad [Bm7]day,   [E]
You had a bad day.

{B_2}
[F#m]Well you need a [E]blue sky holi[D]day,
The point is they [A]laugh at what you [Bm7]say,
And I don't need no carryin' [E]on.

{C}
You had a bad [A]day, you're taking one [D]down,
You sing a sad [Bm7]song just to turn it a[E]round.
You say you don't [A]know, you tell me, don't [D]lie,
You work on a [Bm7]smile and you go for a [E]ride.
You had a bad [F#m]day, the camera don't [E]lie,
You're coming back [D]down and you really don't [A]mind,
You had a bad [Bm7]day.   [E]
You had a bad [A]day.

{B_3}
[E]Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the [A]whole thing it turns out wrong.
You [E]might not make it back and you know that
You could [A]be well oh that strong,
Well I'm not [B]wrong.

{B_4}
[A]So where is the [D]passion when you need it the [E]most?
[A]You kick up the [D]leaves and the magic is [E]lost.

{C}
‘Cause  you had a bad [A]day, you're taking one [D]down,
You sing a sad [Bm7]song just to turn it a[E]round.
You say you don't [A]know, you tell me, don't [D]lie,
You work on a [Bm7]smile and you go for a [E]ride.
You had a bad [F#m]day, you've seen what you [E]like,
And how does it [D]feel for one more [A]time,
You had a bad [Bm7]day,   [E]
You had a bad day.
