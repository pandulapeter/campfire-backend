[D#]Look at this photo[A#]graph,
Every time I do it makes me [C#]laugh,
How did our eyes get so [G#]red?
And what the hell is on Joey's [D#]head?

{V_2}
This is where I grew [A#]up,
I think the present owner fixed it [C#]up,
I never knew we ever went with[G#]out,
The second floor is hard for sneakin' [D#]out.

{V_3}
And this is where I went to [A#]school,
Most of the time I had better things to [C#]do,
Criminal record says I broke in [G#]twice,
I must of done it half a dozen [D#]times.

{V_4}
I wonder if it's too [A#]late,
Should I go back and try to [C#]graduate?
Lot's better now than it was back [G#]then,
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in...

{P}
[F#]Oh, whoa, whoa, [G#]whoa, God, I...

{C}
Every [D#]memory of lookin' out the back door,
I have the [A#]photo album spread out on my bedroom floor,
It's [C#]hard to say it, time to say it
[G#]Goodbye, goodbye!
Every [D#]memory of walkin' out the front door,
I found the [A#]photo of the friend that I was lookin' for,
It's [C#]hard to say it, time to say it
[G#]Goodbye, goodbye!

{B_1}
[D#]    [A#]    [C#]    [G#]
Goodbye!

{V_5}
[D#]Remember the old ar[A#]cade?
Blew every dollar that we ever [C#]made,
The cops hated us hangin' [G#]out,
They said somebody went and burnt it [D#]down.

{V_6}
We use to listen to the radi[A#]o,
And sing along with every song we [C#]know,
We said someday we'd find out how it [G#]feels,
To sing to more than just a steering [D#]wheel.

{V_7}
Kim's the first girl I [A#]kissed,
I was so nervous that I nearly [C#]missed,
She's had a couple of kids since [G#]then,
I haven't seen her since God knows when...

{P}
[F#]Oh, whoa, whoa, [G#]whoa, God, I...

{C}
Every [D#]memory of lookin' out the back door,
I have the [A#]photo album spread out on my bedroom floor,
It's [C#]hard to say it, time to say it
[G#]Goodbye, goodbye!
Every [D#]memory of walkin' out the front door,
I found the [A#]photo of the friend that I was lookin' for,
It's [C#]hard to say it, time to say it
[G#]Goodbye, goodbye!

{B_2}
[B]    [C#]
[D#]I miss that [A#]town,
I miss their [F#]faces,
You can't e[G#]rase,
You can't re[D#]place it.
I miss it [A#]now,
I can't be[F#]lieve it,
So hard to [G#]stay,
Too hard to [D#]leave it.
If I could relive those [A#]days,
I know the one thing that would never [C#]change...

[D#]Look at this photo[A#]graph,
Every time I do it makes me [C#]laugh,
Every time I do it makes me...   [G#]
