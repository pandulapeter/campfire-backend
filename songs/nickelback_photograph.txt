[E]Look at this photo[B]graph,
Every time I do it makes me [D]laugh,
How did our eyes get so [A]red?
And what the hell is on Joey's [E]head?

{V_2}
This is where I grew [B]up,
I think the present owner fixed it [D]up,
I never knew we ever went with[A]out,
The second floor is hard for sneakin' [E]out.

{V_3}
And this is where I went to [B]school,
Most of the time I had better things to [D]do,
Criminal record says I broke in [A]twice,
I must of done it half a dozen [E]times.

{V_4}
I wonder if it's too [B]late,
Should I go back and try to [D]graduate?
Lot's better now than it was back [A]then,
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in...

{P}
[G]Oh, whoa, whoa, [A]whoa, God, I...

Every [E]memory of lookin' out the back door,
I have the [B]photo album spread out on my bedroom floor,
It's [D]hard to say it, time to say it
[A]Goodbye, goodbye!
Every [E]memory of walkin' out the front door,
I found the [B]photo of the friend that I was lookin' for,
It's [D]hard to say it, time to say it
[A]Goodbye, goodbye!

[E]    [B]    [D]    [A]
Goodbye!

{V_5}
[E]Remember the old ar[B]cade?
Blew every dollar that we ever [D]made,
The cops hated us hangin' [A]out,
They said somebody went and burnt it [E]down.

{V_6}
We use to listen to the radi[B]o,
And sing along with every song we [D]know,
We said someday we'd find out how it [A]feels,
To sing to more than just a steering [E]wheel.

{V_7}
Kim's the first girl I [B]kissed,
I was so nervous that I nearly [D]missed,
She's had a couple of kids since [A]then,
I haven't seen her since God knows when...

{P}
[G]Oh, whoa, whoa, [A]whoa, God, I...

{C}
Every [E]memory of lookin' out the back door,
I have the [B]photo album spread out on my bedroom floor,
It's [D]hard to say it, time to say it
[A]Goodbye, goodbye!
Every [E]memory of walkin' out the front door,
I found the [B]photo of the friend that I was lookin' for,
It's [D]hard to say it, time to say it
[A]Goodbye, goodbye!

{B_2}
[C]    [D]
[E]I miss that [B]town,
I miss their [G]faces,
You can't e[A]rase,
You can't re[E]place it.
I miss it [B]now,
I can't be[G]lieve it,
So hard to [A]stay,
Too hard to [E]leave it.
If I could relive those [B]days,
I know the one thing that would never [D]change...

[E]Look at this photo[B]graph,
Every time I do it makes me [D]laugh,
Every time I do it makes me...   [A]
