[B]    [F#]    [G#m]    [E]

{V_1}
Well [B]you done done me and you bet I felt it,
I [F#]tried to be chill but you're so hot I melted,
I [G#m]fell right through the cracks,
And now I'm [E]trying to get back.

{V_2}
Before the [B]cool done run out I'll be giving it my best-est,
And [F#]nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention,
I [G#m]reckon it's again my turn,
To [E]win some or learn some.

{C_1}
But [B]I won't hesi[F#]tate no more, no [G#m]more,
It cannot [E]wait, I'm yours.

{B}
[B]    [F#]    [G#m]    [E]

{V_3}
[B]Well open up your mind and see like [F#]me,
Open up your plans and damn you're [G#m]free.
Look into your heart and you'll find [E]love, love, love, love.

{V_4}
[B]Listen to the music of the moment people dance and [F#]sing,
We are just one big fami[G#m]ly,
And it's our God-forsaken right to be [E]loved, loved, loved, loved,
[C#7]Loved...

{C_2}
So [B]I won't hesi[F#]tate no more, no [G#m]more,
It cannot [E]wait I'm sure,

{C_3}
There's no [B]need to compli[F#]cate, our time is [G#m]short.
This is our [E]fate, I'm yours.

{B}
[B]    [F#]    [G#m]    [E]    [x2]

{V_5}
I've been [B]spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror,
And [F#]bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer,
But my [G#m]breath fogged up the glass,
And so I [E]drew a new face and I laughed.

{V_6}
I [B]guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason,
To [F#]rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons,
It's [G#m]what we aim to do,
Our [E]name is our virtue.

{C_1}
But [B]I won't hesi[F#]tate no more, no [G#m]more,
It cannot [E]wait, I'm yours.

{O}
[B]Well open up your mind and see like [F#]me,
Open up your plans and damn you're [G#m]free.
Look into your heart and you'll find [E]the sky is yours.
So [B]please don't, please don't, please don't,
There's no [F#]need to complicate,
'Cause our [G#m]time is short.
This, oh this, this is our [E]fate, I'm yours.[C#7]
