[C]    [G]    [Am]    [F]

{V_1}
Well [C]you done done me and you bet I felt it,
I [G]tried to be chill but you're so hot I melted,
I [Am]fell right through the cracks,
And now I'm [F]trying to get back.

{V_2}
Before the [C]cool done run out I'll be giving it my best-est,
And [G]nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention,
I [Am]reckon it's again my turn,
To [F]win some or learn some.

{C_1}
But [C]I won't hesi[G]tate no more, no [Am]more,
It cannot [F]wait, I'm yours.

{B}
[C]    [G]    [Am]    [F]

{V_3}
[C]Well open up your mind and see like [G]me,
Open up your plans and damn you're [Am]free.
Look into your heart and you'll find [F]love, love, love, love.

{V_4}
[C]Listen to the music of the moment people dance and [G]sing,
We are just one big fami[Am]ly,
And it's our God-forsaken right to be [F]loved, loved, loved, loved,
[D7]Loved...

{C_2}
So [C]I won't hesi[G]tate no more, no [Am]more,
It cannot [F]wait I'm sure,

{C_3}
There's no [C]need to compli[G]cate, our time is [Am]short.
This is our [F]fate, I'm yours.

{B}
[C]    [G]    [Am]    [F]    [x2]

{V_5}
I've been [C]spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror,
And [G]bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer,
But my [Am]breath fogged up the glass,
And so I [F]drew a new face and I laughed.

{V_6}
I [C]guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason,
To [G]rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons,
It's [Am]what we aim to do,
Our [F]name is our virtue.

{C_1}
But [C]I won't hesi[G]tate no more, no [Am]more,
It cannot [F]wait, I'm yours.

{O}
[C]Well open up your mind and see like [G]me,
Open up your plans and damn you're [Am]free.
Look into your heart and you'll find [F]the sky is yours.
So [C]please don't, please don't, please don't,
There's no [G]need to complicate,
'Cause our [Am]time is short.
This, oh this, this is our [F]fate, I'm yours.[D7]
