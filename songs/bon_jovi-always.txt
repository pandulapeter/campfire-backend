{V_1}
[C#m]This Romeo is bleeding,
[B]But you can't see his blood,
[A]It's nothing but some feelings,
That this [G#m]old dog kicked up.   [B]

{V_2}
[C#m]It's been raining since you left me,
Now I'm [B]drowning in the flood.
[A]You see I've always been a fighter,
But with[G#]out you I give up.   [B]

{P}
[C#m]Now I can't sing a love song,
Like the [B]way it's meant to be,
Well, I [A]guess I'm not that good anymore,
But [B]baby, that's just [A]me.   [B]

{C}
Yeah [E]I, will [B]love you, ba[F#m]by,
[C#m]Alwa[B]ys and [E]I'll be there,
For[B]ever and a [A]day, [C#m]alwa[B]ys.
[E]I'll be there, till the stars don't shine,
'Til the [B]heavens burst and the words don't rhyme,
I know [A]when I die you'll be on my mind,
And I'll [B]love you, [A]alwa[B]ys.   [C#m]    [A]

{V_3}
Now your [C#m]pictures that you left behind,
Are just [B]memories of a different life,
Some that [A]made us laugh, some that made us cry,
One that [G#m]made you have to say goodbye.   [B]

{V_4}
What I'd [C#m]give to run my fingers through your hair,
[B]Touch your lips, to hold you near,
When you [A]say your prayers, try to understand,
I've [G#m]made mistakes, I'm [A]just a man.   [B]

{P}
When he [C#m]holds you close, when he pulls you near,
When he [B]says the words you've been needing to hear,
I'll wish [A]I was him, 'cause these words are mine,
To [B]say to you, till the [A]end of [B]time.

{C}
Yeah [E]I, will [B]love you, ba[F#m]by,
[C#m]Alwa[B]ys and [E]I'll be there,
For[B]ever and a [A]day, [C#m]alwa[B]ys.

{B_1}
[D]If you told me to cr[G]y for you,[A] I could.
[D]If you told me to di[G]e for you[A], I would.   [Bm]
Take a look at my [G]face,
There's no price I won't [A]pay,
To say these words to you.

{B_2}
Well, there [A]ain't no luck in these loaded dice,
But [B]baby, if you give me just one more try,
We can [A/C#]pack up our old dreams, and our old lives,
We'll [B]find a place, where the sun still shines.

{C}
Yeah [E]I, will [B]love you, ba[F#m]by,
[C#m]Alwa[B]ys and [E]I'll be there,
For[B]ever and a [A]day, [C#m]alwa[B]ys.
[E]I'll be there, till the stars don't shine,
'Til the [B]heavens burst and the words don't rhyme,
I know [A]when I die you'll be on my mind,
And I'll [B]love you, [A]alwa[B]ys.
