[C#]This is the way you left me,
[G#]I'm not pretending,
[A#m]No hope, no love, no glory,
[F#]No happy ending.
[C#]This is the way that we love,
[G#]Like it's forever,
[A#m]Then live the rest of our life,
[F#]But not together.

[C#]Wake up in the [G#]morning, [A#m]stumble on my [F#]life,
[C#]Can't get no [G#]love without [A#m]sacrifi[F#]ce,
[C#]If anything should [G#]happen, [A#m]I guess I wish you [F#]well,
[C#]Mmm a little bit of [G#]heaven, [A#m]but a little bit of [F#]hell.

{P}
[A#m]This is the hardest story [Fm]that I have ever told,
[F#]No hope, or love, or glory, happy endings [G#]gone forever [C#]more.
I [G#]feel as if I'm [A#m]wasting,   [F#]
And[C#] I'm [G#]wasting every [A#m]day.   [F#]

[C#]Two o'clock in the [G#]morning, [A#m]someone's on my [F#]mind,
[C#]Can't get no [G#]rest, keep [A#m]walking a[F#]round.
[C#]If I pre[G#]tend that nothing [A#m]ever went [F#]wrong,
[C#]I can get to my [G#]sleep, I can dream now and [A#m]just carry [F#]on?
