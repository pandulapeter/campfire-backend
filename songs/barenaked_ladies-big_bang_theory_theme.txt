{I}
Our [C]whole uni[D]verse was in a
[G]Hot, [D/F#]dense [Em]state,
Then nearly [C]fourteen billion [D]years ago
Ex[G]pansion [D/F#]started, [-]wait...

{V_1}
The [C]Earth began to [D]cool,
The auto[G]trophs began to [Em]drool,
Neander[C]thals developed [D]tools,
We built a [G]wall (we built the [Em]pyramids!)
[C]Math, science, [D]history,
Un[G]ravel[D/F#]ing the [Em]mystery,
That [C]all started [D]with the big [-]bang ([G]bang!)

{V_2}
Since the [C]dawn of [D]man
Is really [G]not that [Em]long,
As every [C]galaxy was [D]formed
In less time [G]than it takes to [Em]sing this song.
A [C]fraction of a [D]second,
And the [G]elements were [Em]made.
The [C]bipeds stood up [D]straight,
The dino[G]saurs all met their [Em]fate.
They tried to [C]leap but they were [D]late,
And they all [G]died (they froze their [Em]asses off!)
The [C]oceans and [D]Pangea,
See ya, [G]wouldn't [D/F#]wanna [Em]be ya!
Set in [C]motion by the [D]same big [G]bang.

{B}
It [C]all started [D]with the big - [Am7]bang!
[D]It's ex[G]panding [C]ever [G]outward [C]but one [Am7]day,
[D]It will [G]cause the [C]stars to [G]go the [C]other [Am7]way.
Collapsing [D]ever inward,
[Am7]We won't be here, [D]it won't be hurt.
[Am7]Our best and [G/B]brightest figure,
That [C]it'll make an [D]even bigger bang!

{S}
[Am7]        [D]
[G]    [C]    [G]    [C]
[Am7]        [D]
[G]    [C]    [G]

{V_3}
[C]Australo[D]pithecus
Would [G]really have been [Em]sick of us,
De[C]bating how we're [D]here,
They're catching [G]deer (we're catching [Em]viruses!)
Re[C]ligion or as[D]tronomy,
Des[G]cartes or [D/F#]Deuter[Em]onomy,
It [C]all started [D]with the big [G]bang.

{O}
[C]Music and [D]mythology,
[G]Einstein [D/F#]and ast[Em]rology,
It [C]all started [D]with the big [G]bang.
It [C]all started [D]with the big - [G]bang!
