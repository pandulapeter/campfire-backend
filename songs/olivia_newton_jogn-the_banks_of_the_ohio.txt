{V_1}
I asked my [D]love to take a [A]walk,
To take a [A7]walk, just a little [D]walk.
Down be[D7]side where the waters [G]flow,   [Gm]
Down by the [D]banks[A7] of the Ohi[D]o.

{C}
And only [D]say that you'll be [A]mine,
In no [A7]others' arms ent[D]wine.
Down be[D7]side where the waters [G]flow,   [Gm]
Down by the [D]banks[A7] of the Ohi[D]o.

{V_2}
I held a [D]knife against his [A]breast,
As into [A7]my arms he [D]pressed.
He cried "My [D7]love, don't you murder [G]me,   [Gm]
I'm not pre[D]pared[A7] for eterni[D]ty."

{C}
And only [D]say that you'll be [A]mine,
In no [A7]others' arms ent[D]wine.
Down be[D7]side where the waters [G]flow,   [Gm]
Down by the [D]banks[A7] of the Ohi[D]o.

{V_3}
I wandered [D]home 'tween twelve and [A]one.
I cried, "My [A7]God, what have I [D]done?"
I've killed the [D7]only man I [G]loved,   [Gm]
He would not [D]take me [A7]for his [D]bride.

{C}
And only [D]say that you'll be [A]mine,
In no [A7]others' arms ent[D]wine.
Down be[D7]side where the waters [G]flow,   [Gm]
Down by the [D]banks[A7] of the Ohi[D]o.
