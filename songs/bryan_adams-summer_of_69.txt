{V_1}
[D]I got my first real six-string,
[A]Bought it at the five-and-dime,
[D]Played it 'til my fingers bled,
[A]Was the summer of sixty-nine.

{V_2}
[D]Me and some guys from school,
[A]Had a band and we tried real hard.
[D]Jimmy quit, Jody got married,
[A]I should've known we'd never get far.

{C_1}
[Bm]Oh, when I [A]look back now,
[D]That summer seemed to [G]last forever,
[Bm]And if I [A]had the choice,
[D]Yeah, I'd always [G]wanna be there,
[Bm]Those were the [A]best days of my [D]life.   [A]

{V_3}
[D]Ain't no use in complainin',
[A]When you've got a job to do.
[D]Spent my evenings down at the drive-in,
[A]And that's when I met you, yeah!

{C_2}
[Bm]Standin' on your [A]mama's porch,
[D]You told me that you'd [G]wait forever.
[Bm]Oh, and when you [A]held my hand,
[D]I knew that it was [G]now or never,
[Bm]Those were the [A]best days of my [D]life.
Oh, [A]yeah,
Back in the summer of [D]sixty-nine, [A]oh!

{B}
[F]Man, we were [A#]killin' time,
We were [C]young and restless,
We [A#]needed to unwind.
[F]I guess [A#]nothin' can last for[C]ever, forever, no!

{V_3}
[D]And now the times are changin',
[A]Look at everything that's come and gone.
[D]Sometimes when I play that old six-string,
[A]I think about you, wonder what went wrong.

{C_2}
[Bm]Standin' on your [A]mama's porch,
[D]You told me that it'd [G]last forever.
[Bm]Oh, and when you [A]held my hand,
[D]I knew that it was [G]now or never,
[Bm]Those were the [A]best days of my [D]life.
Oh, [A]yeah,
Back in the summer of [D]sixty-nine, [A]oh!

{O}
It was the summer of [D]sixty-nine, oh, [A]yeah!
Me and my baby in [D]sixty-nine, [A]oh!
