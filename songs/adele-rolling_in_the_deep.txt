{V_1}
[Bm]There's a fire [F#m]starting in my heart,
[A]Reaching a fever pitch and it's [F#m]bringing me out the [A]dark.
[Bm]Finally I can [F#m]see you crystal clear,
[A]Go 'head and sell me out and [F#m]I'll lay your ship [A]bare.

{V_2}
[Bm]See how I leave with [F#m]every piece of you,
[A]Don't underestimate the [F#m]things that I will [A]do.
[Bm]There's a fire [F#m]starting in my heart,
[A]Reaching a fever pitch and its [F#m]bringing me out the [A]dark.

{P}
[G]The scars of [A]your love remind me [F#m]of us,
They keep me [G]thinking that we almost had it [G]all.
The scars of [A]your love, they leave me [F#m]breathless,
I can't help [F#7]feeling...

{C}
We could have had it [Bm]all (You're gonna wish you [A]never had met me),
Rolling in the [G]deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep).
You [A]had my heart in[Bm]side (You're gonna wish you) of your [A]hand (never had met me),
And you [G]played it (Tears are gonna fall) to the beat (rolling in the [A]deep).

{V_3}
Yeah, [Bm]baby I have no [F#m]story to be told,
But [A]I've heard one on you and I'm [F#m]gonna make your head [A]burn.
[Bm]Think of me in the [F#m]depths of your despair,
[A]Making a home down there 'cause [F#m]mine sure won't be [A]shared.

{P}
([G]You're gonna wish you) The scars of ([A]never had met me) your love remind me of ([F#m]tears are gonna fall) us,
They keep me ([G]rolling in the deep) thinking that we almost had it ([G]you're gonna wish you) all.
The scars of ([A]never had met me) your love, they leave me ([F#m]tears are gonna fall) breathless,
I can't help ([F#7]rolling in the deep) feeling...

{C}
We could have had it [Bm]all (You're gonna wish you [A]never had met me),
Rolling in the [G]deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep).
You [A]had my heart in[Bm]side (You're gonna wish you) of your [A]hand (never had met me),
And you [G]played it (Tears are gonna fall) to the beat (rolling in the [A]deep).

{B_1}
We could've had it [G]all,   [A]
Rolling in the [Bm]deep.   [A]
You had my heart in[G]side of your hand,
But you [A]played it with a beating.

{V_4}
[Bm]Throw your soul through every open door (whoa),
[-]Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa).
[Bm]Turned my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa),
You'll [Bm]pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.

{B_2}
([Bm]You're gonna wish you [A]never had met me) We could have had it all,
([G]Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the [A]deep) We could have had it all.
([Bm]You're gonna wish you [A]never had met me) Yeah!
([G]Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the [A]deep) It all, it all, it all...

{C}
We could have had it [Bm]all (You're gonna wish you [A]never had met me),

But you [G]played it, you played it, you played it, you [A]played it to the [Bm]beat.
