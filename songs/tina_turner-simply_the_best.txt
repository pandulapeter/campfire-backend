{V_1}
I [F]call you when I need you, my heart's on fire.
You [F]come to me, come to me wild and wired.
Oh, you come to [Dm]me, give me everything [A#sus2]I need.

{V_2}
Give me a [F]life time of promises and a world of dreams,
Speak the [F]language of love like you know what it means.
And it can't be [Dm]wrong, take my heart and make it [A#]strong.   [C]

{C}
You're simply the [F]best, better than all the rest,
Better than [Dm]anyone, anyone I [C]ever met.
I'm [C7]stuck on your [F]heart, I hang on every word you say,
Tear us a[Dm]part, baby, I would [C]rather be dead.   [C7]

{V_3}
In your [F]heart I see the start of every night and every day.
In your [F]eyes I get lost, I get washed away.
Just as [Dm]long here in your arms I could be in no [A#]better place.   [C]

{C}
You're simply the [F]best, better than all the rest,
Better than [Dm]anyone, anyone I [C]ever met.
I'm [C7]stuck on your [F]heart, I hang on every word you say,
Tear us a[Dm]part, baby, I would [C]rather be dead.   [C7]

{B}
[A#]Each time you leave me I start losing control,
You're [Dm]walking away with my heart and my soul.
[A#]I can feel you even when I'm alone,
[C]Oh, baby, don't let [D]go!

{S}
[G]    [G]    [Em]    [D]

{C}
You're the [G]best, better than all the rest,
Better than [Em]anyone, anyone I [D]ever met.
I'm [D7]stuck on your [G]heart, I hang on every word you say,
Tear us a[Em]part, baby, I would [D]rather be dead.

{O}
[D7]Oh, you're the [G]best!
