I [F#]hear the train a comin',
It's rollin' 'round the bend,
And I ain't seen the sunshine,
Since, I don't know when,
I'm [B]stuck in Folsom Prison,
And time keeps draggin' [F#]on,
But that [C#7]train keeps a-rollin',
On down to San An[F#]tone.

{V_2}
When [F#]I was just a baby,
My Mama told me, \"Son,
Always be a good boy,
Don't ever play with guns,\"
But I [B]shot a man in Reno,
Just to watch him [F#]die.
When I [C#7]hear that whistle blowin',
I hang my head and [F#]cry.

I [F#]bet there's rich folks eatin',
In a fancy dining car,
They're probably drinkin' coffee,
And smokin' big cigars,
But I [B]know I had it comin',
I know I can't be [F#]free,
But those [C#7]people keep a-movin',
And that's what tortures [F#]me.

Well, if they [F#]freed me from this prison,
If that railroad train was mine,
I bet I'd move out over a little
Farther down the line,
[B]Far from Folsom Prison,
That's where I want to [F#]stay,
And I'd [C#7]let that lonesome whistle,
Blow my blues [F#]away.
