{V_1}
I'm [Am]sitting here in the [Em]boring room,
It's [Am]just another rainy Sunday [Em]afternoon,
I'm [Am]wasting my time, I got [Em]nothing to do,
I'm [Am]hanging around, I'm [Em]waiting for you,
But [Dm]nothing ever happens[Em] and I [Am]wonder.   [Em]    [Am]    [-]

{V_2}
I'm [Am]driving around [Em]in my car,
I'm [Am]driving too fast, I'm [Em]driving too far.
I'd [Am]like to change my [Em]point of view,
I [Am]feel so lonely, I'm [Em]waiting for you,
But [Dm]nothing ever happens[Em] and I [Am]wonder.   [Em]    [Am]

{C}
I [C]wonder how, I [G]wonder why,
[Am]Yesterday you told me 'bout the [Em]blue blue sky,
And [F]all that I can [G]see is just a yellow [C]lemon-tree. [G]
I'm [C]turning my head [G]up and down,
I'm [Am]turning, turning, turning, turning, [Em]turning around,
And [F]all that I can [D7]see is just another [G]lemon-tree.

{V_3}
I'm [Am]sitting here, I [Em]miss the power.
I'd [Am]like to go out, [Em]taking a shower,
But [Am]there's a heavy cloud in[Em]side my head,
I [Am]feel so tired, put my[Em]self into bed,
While [Dm]nothing ever happens[Em] and I [Am]wonder.   [Em]    [Am]

{B_2}
[Dm]Isolation [Am]is not good for me.
[G]Isolation, [C]I don't want to [Em]sit on the lemon-tree.

{V_4}
I'm [Am]steppin' around in the [Em]desert of joy,
[Am]Baby anyhow I'll get a[Em]nother toy,
And [Dm]everything will happen,[Em] and you [Am]wonder.   [Em]    [Am]

{C}
I [C]wonder how, I [G]wonder why,
[Am]Yesterday you told me 'bout the [Em]blue blue sky,

I'm [Am]turning, turning, turning, turning, [Em]turning around,
And [F]all that I can [D7]see is just another [G]lemon-tree.
And I [G]wonder, wonder,

[Am]Yesterday you told me 'bout the [Em]blue blue sky,
And [F]all that I can [G]see,
And [F]all that I can [G]see,
And [F]all that I can [G]see,
Is just a yellow [C]lemon-tree.
