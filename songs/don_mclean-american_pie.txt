A [G]long,[D/F#] long t[Em]ime ago,
[Am]I can still reme[C]mber how that music[Em] used to make me [D]smile.
And [G]I knew if [D/F#]I had my [Em]chance,
That [Am]I could make those [C]people dance,
And [Em]maybe they'd be [C]happy for a while.[D]
But [Em]February [Am]made me shiver
With [Em]every paper [Am]I'd deliver.
[C]Bad news [G/C]on the [Am]doorstep,
I [C]couldn't take one [D]more step.
I [G]can't re[D/F#]member [Em]if I cried
When I [Am]read about his [D]widowed bride.
[G]Something [D/F#]touched me [Em]deep inside
The [C]day the [D]music [G]died.

{C}
So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D]die.

{V_1}
[G]Did you write the [Am]book of love,
And do [C]you have faith in [Am]God above,
[Em]If the Bible [D]tells you so?
Do [G]you be[D/F#]lieve in [Em]rock and roll,
Can [Am]music save your [C]mortal soul,
And [Em]can you teach me [A7]how to dance [D]real slow?
Well, I [Em]know that you're in [Am]love with him
'Cause I [Em]saw you dancin' [Am]in the gym.
You [C]both kicked[G/C] off y[Am]our shoes,
Man, I [C]dig those rhythm and [D]blues!
I was a [G]lonely [D/F#]teenage [Em]broncin' buck,
With a [Am]pink carnation and a [C]pickup truck,
But I [G]knew [D/F#]I was o[Em]ut of luck
The [C]day the [D]music [G]died.   [C]
[G]I started [D]singin'...

{C}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D]die.

{V_2}
Now, for [G]ten years we've been [Am]on our own,
And [C]moss grows fat on a [Am]rolling stone,
But [Em]that's not how it used to [D]be.
When the [G]jester [D/F#]sang for the [Em]king and queen
In a [Am]coat he borrowed from [C]James Dean,
And a [Em]voice that [A7]came from you and [D]me.
Oh and [Em]while the king was [Am]looking down,
The [Em]jester stole his [Am]thorny crown.
The [C]courtroom [G/C]was ad[Am]journed,
[C]No verdict was re[D]turned.
And while [G]Lennon [D/F#]read a [Em]book on Marx,
The [Am]quartet practiced [C]in the park,
[G]And we sang [D/F#]dirges [Em]in the dark,
The [C]day the [D]music [G]died.   [C]
[G]We were [D]singin'...

{C}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D]die.

{V_3}
[G]Helter skelter [Am]in a summer swelter,
The [C]birds flew off with a [Am]fallout shelter,
[Em]Eight miles high and [D]falling fast,
It [G]landed[D/F#] foul o[Em]n the grass,
The [Am]players tried for a [C]forward pass,
With the [Em]jester on the [A7]sidelines in a [D]cast.
Now the [Em]half-time air was [Am]sweet perfume,
While [Em]sergeants played a [Am]marching tune.
We [C]all got [G/C]up to [Am]dance,
Oh, but we [C]never got the [D]chance.
'Cause the [G]players [D/F#]tried to [Em]take the field,
The [Am]marching band re[C]fused to yield.
[G]Do you re[D/F#]call what [Em]was revealed,
The [C]day the [D]music [G]died.   [C]
[G]We were [D]singin'...

{C}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D]die.

{V_4}
Oh, and [G]there we were all [Am]in one place,
A [C]generation [Am]lost in space,
With [Em]no time left to [D]start again.
So come on, [G]Jack be [D/F#]nimble, [Em]Jack be quick,
[Am]Jack Flash sat on a [C]candlestick,
'Cause [Em]fire is the [A7]devil's only [D]friend.
Oh and [Em]as I watched him [Am]on the stage,
My [Em]hands were clenched in [Am]fists of rage.
[C]No angel [G/C]born in [Am]hell
Could [C]break that Satan's [D]spell.
And as the [G]flames climbed [D/F#]high in[Em]to the night,
To [Am]light the sacri[C]ficial rite,
I saw [G]Satan [D/F#]laughing [Em]with delight
The [C]day the [D]music [G]died.   [C]
[G]He was [D]singin'...

{C}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D]die.

{B}
[G]I met a [D/F#]girl who [Em]sang the blues,
And I [Am]asked her for some [C]happy news,
But [Em]she just smiled and [D]turned away.
[G]I went [D/F#]down to the [Em]sacred store,
Where I'd [Am]heard the music [C]years before,
But the [Em]man there said the [C]music wouldn't [D]play.
And [Em]in the streets the [Am]children screamed,
The [Em]lovers cried, and the [Am]poets dreamed,
But [C]not a [G/C]word was [Am]spoken,
The [C]church bells all were [D]broken.
And the [G]three men[D/F#] I admi[Em]re most,
The [Am]Father, Son, and the [D]Holy Ghost,
[G]They caught the [D/F#]last train [Em]for the coast
The [C]day the [D]music [G]died.   [-]
And they were singin'...

{C}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D]die.
They were singin'...

{O}
