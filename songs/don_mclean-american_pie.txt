A [G]long, [D]long [Em]time ago,
[Am]I can still r[C]emember how that [Em]music used to [D]make me smile.
And [G]I knew if I [D]had my [Em]chance,
That [Am]I could make those [C]people dance,
And [Em]maybe they'd be [C]happy for a [D]while.
But [Em]February [Am]made me shiver
With [Em]every paper [Am]I'd deliver.
[C]Bad news [G]on the [Am]doorstep,
I [C]couldn't take [D]one more step.
I [G]can't re[D]member [Em]if I cried
When I [Am]read about his [D]widowed bride.
[G]Something [D]touched me [Em]deep inside
The [C]day the [D7]music [G]died.

{C}
So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D7]die.

{V_1}
[G]Did you write the [Am]book of love,
And do [C]you have faith in [Am]God above,
If the [Em]Bible [D]tells you so?
Do [G]you be[D]lieve in [Em]rock and roll,
Can [Am]music save your [C]mortal soul,
And [Em]can you teach me [A7]how to dance [D7]real slow?
Well, I [Em]know that you're in [Am]love with him
'Cause I [Em]saw you dancin' [Am]in the gym.
You [C]both kicked [G]off [A7]your shoes,
Man, I [C]dig those rhythm and [D7]blues!
I was a [G]lonely [D]teenage [Em]broncin' buck,
With a [Am]pink carnation and a [C]pickup truck,
But I [G]knew [D]I was [Em]out of luck
The [C]day the [D7]music [G]died.   [C]
[G]I started [D7]singin'...

{C}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D7]die.

{V_2}
Now, for [G]ten years we've been [Am]on our own,
And [C]moss grows fat on a [Am]rolling stone,
But [Em]that's not how it used to [D]be.
When the [G]jester [D]sang for the [Em]king and queen
In a [Am]coat he borrowed from [C]James Dean,
And a [Em]voice that came from [A7]you and [D7]me.
Oh and [Em]while the king was [Am]looking down,
The [Em]jester stole his [Am]thorny crown.
The [C]courtroom [G]was ad[A7]journed,
No [C]verdict was re[D7]turned.
And while [G]Lennon [D]read a [Em]book on Marx,
The [Am]quartet practiced [C]in the park,
[G]And we sang [D]dirges [Em]in the dark,
The [C]day the [D7]music [G]died.   [C]
[G]We were [D7]singin'...

{C}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D7]die.

{V_3}
[G]Helter skelter [Am]in a summer swelter,
The [C]birds flew off with a [Am]fallout shelter,
[Em]Eight miles high and falling [D]fast,
It [G]landed [D]foul [Em]on the grass,
The [Am]players tried for a [C]forward pass,
With the [Em]jester on the sidelines [A7]in a [D7]cast.
Now the [Em]half-time air was [Am]sweet perfume,
While [Em]sergeants played a [Am]marching tune.
We [C]all got [G]up to [A7]dance,
Oh, but we [C]never got the [D7]chance.
'Cause the [G]players [D]tried to [Em]take the field,
The [Am]marching band re[C]fused to yield.
Do [G]you re[D]call what [Em]was revealed,
The [C]day the [D7]music [G]died.   [C]
[G]We were [D7]singin'...

{C}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D7]die.

{V_4}
Oh, and [G]there we were all [Am]in one place,
A [C]generation [Am]lost in space,
With [Em]no time left to start a[D]gain.
So come on, [G]Jack be [D]nimble, [Em]Jack be quick,
[Am]Jack Flash sat on a [C]candlestick,
'Cause [Em]fire is the [A7]devil's only [D7]friend.
Oh and [Em]as I watched him [Am]on the stage,
My [Em]hands were clenched in [Am]fists of rage.
No [C]angel [G]born in [A7]hell
Could [C]break that Satan's [D7]spell.
And as the [G]flames climbed [D]high in[Em]to the night,
To [Am]light the sacri[C]ficial rite,
I saw [G]Satan [D]laughing [Em]with delight
The [C]day the [D7]music [G]died.   [C]
[G]He was [D7]singin'...

{C}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D7]die.

{B}
I [G]met a [D]girl who [Em]sang the blues,
And I [Am]asked her for some [C]happy news,
But [Em]she just smiled and [D]turned away.
[G]I went [D]down to the [Em]sacred store,
Where I'd [Am]heard the music [C]years before,
But the [Em]man there said the [C]music wouldn't [D]play.
And [Em]in the streets the [Am]children screamed,
The [Em]lovers cried, and the [Am]poets dreamed,
But [C]not a [G]word was [Am]spoken,
The [C]church bells all were [D]broken.
And the [G]three men [D]I ad[Em]mire most,
The [Am]Father, Son, and the [D]Holy Ghost,
[G]They caught the [D]last train [Em]for the coast
The [C]day the [D7]music [G]died.   [-]
And they were [D7]singin'...

{C}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die,
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D7]die.

{O}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie,
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee but the [G]levee was [D]dry.
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye,
