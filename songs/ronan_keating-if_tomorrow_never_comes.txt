{V_1}
Sometimes late at [Cm7]night,   [F]
I lie awake and watch her[D#] sleep[A#]ing.   [Cm/A#]      [A#]
She's [F]lost in peaceful [Cm7]dreams,
So I turn [F]out the lights and [D#]lay there in the [A#]dark.   [D#/A#]      [A#]

{V_2}
And the thought crosses my [Cm7]mind,   [F]
If I never wake in the[D#] mor[A#]ning,   [Cm/A#]      [A#]
[F]Would she ever [Cm7]doubt
The [F]way I feel a[D#]bout her in my [A#]heart.   [D#/A#]      [A#]

{C}
If tomorrow never [D#]comes,
Will she know how much I [A#]loved her?
Did I try in every [F]way to [Cm7]show her every [F]day,
That [D#]she's my only [A#]one?
And if my [Cm7]time on [A#/D]earth were [D#]through,
And she must face this [F]world with[Gm7]out me,
Is the love I gave her in the [Cm7]past,
Gonna be enough to [F]last,
If tomorrow never [A#]comes?   [F/A#]      [D#/A#]      [A#]

{V_3}
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my [Cm7]life,   [F]
Who never knew how much I [D#]loved [A#]them.   [Cm/A#]      [A#]
Now I [F]live with the reg[Cm7]ret,
That my true [F]feelings for them [D#]never were re[A#]vealed.   [D#/A#]      [A#]

{V_4}
So I made a promise to [Cm7]myself,   [F]
To say each day how much she [D#]means to [A#]me,   [Cm/A#]      [A#]
And a[F]void that circum[Cm7]stance,
Where there's no [F]second chance to [D#]tell her how I [A#]feel.   [D#/A#]      [A#]

{C}
If to[Cm7]morrow [A#/D]never [D#]comes,
Will she know how much I [A#]loved her?
Did I try in every [F]way to [Cm7]show her every [F]day,
That [D#]she's my only [A#]one?   [D#/A#]      [A#]
And if my [Cm7]time on [A#/D]earth were [D#]through,
And she must face this [F]world with[Gm7]out me,
Is the love I gave her in the [Cm7]past,
Gonna be enough to [F]last,
If tomorrow never [A#]comes?   [F/A#]      [D#/A#]      [A#]

{O}
So tell that someone that you [Cm7]love,
Just what you're thinking [F]of,
If tomorrow never [A#]comes.   [F/A#]      [D#/A#]      [A#]
