{V_1}
Now, I've [C]heard there was[C/B] a s[Am]ecret chord,
That [C]David played, and[C/B] it pl[Am]eased the Lord,
But [F]you don't really [G]care for music, [C]do you?   [G]
It [C]goes like this, the [F]fourth, the [G]fifth,
The [Am]minor fall, the [F]major lift,
The [G]baffled king com[Em]posing halle[Am]lujah.

{C}
Halle[F]lujah,
Halle[Am]lujah,
Halle[F]lujah,
Halle[C]luuu[G]uuuu[C]jah.   [G]

{V_2}
Your [C]faith was strong but [C/B]you n[Am]eeded proof,
You [C]saw her bath[C/B]ing o[Am]n the roof,
Her [F]beauty and the [G]moonlight over[C]threw ya.   [G]
She [C]tied you to a [F]kitchen [G]chair,
She [Am]broke your throne, and she [F]cut your hair,
And [G]from your lips she [Em]drew the halle[Am]lujah.

Halle[F]lujah,

{V_3}
You [C]say I took[C/B] the [Am]name in vain,
[C]I don't ev[C/B]en k[Am]now the name,
But [F]if I did, well [G]really, what's it [C]to you?   [G]
There's a [C]blaze of light in [F]every [G]word,
It [Am]doesn't matter [F]which you heard,
The [G]holy or the [Em]broken halle[Am]lujah.

{C}
Halle[F]lujah,
Halle[Am]lujah,
Halle[F]lujah,
Halle[C]luuu[G]uuuu[C]jah.   [G]

{V_4}
I [C]did my best,[C/B] it w[Am]asn't much,
I [C]couldn't feel, so[C/B] I [Am]tried to touch,
I've [F]told the truth, I [G]didn't come to [C]fool you.   [G]
And [C]even though it [F]all went [G]wrong,
I'll [Am]stand before the [F]lord of song,
With [G]nothing on my [Em]tongue but halle[Am]lujah.

{C}
Halle[F]lujah,

Halle[C]luuu[G]jah.
