{V_1}
Well Jo'[A]anna she runs a [D]country,
She runs in [A]Durban and the [E]Transvaal,
She makes a [A]few of her people [D]happy, oh,
She don't [A]care about the [E]rest at [A]all.

{V_2}
She's got a [A]system they call a[D]partheid,
It keeps a [A]brother in a subjec[E]tion,
But maybe [A]pressure will make Jo'[D]anna see,
How every[A]body could a [E]live as [A]one.

{C}
Gimme [A]hope, Jo'anna,
[D]Hope, Jo'anna,
Gimme [A]hope, Jo'anna,
'Fore the [E]morning come.
Gimme [A]hope, Jo'anna,
[D]Hope, Jo'anna,
[A]Hope before the [E]morning [A]come.

{V_3}
I hear she [A]makes all the golden [D]money,
To buy new [A]weapons, any shape of [E]guns,
While every [A]mother in black So[D]weto fears,
The [A]killing of a[E]nother [A]son.

{V_4}
Sneakin' a[A]cross all the neighbors' [D]borders,
Now and a[A]gain having little [E]fun,
She doesn't [A]care if the fun and [D]games she play
Is [A]dang'rous to [E]ev'ry[A]one.

{C}
Oh, gimme [A]hope, Jo'anna,
[D]Hope, Jo'anna,
Gimme [A]hope, Jo'anna,
'Fore the [E]morning come.
Gimme [A]hope, Jo'anna,
[D]Hope, Jo'anna,
[A]Hope before the [E]morning [A]come.

{V_5}
She's got sup[A]porters in high up [D]places,
Who turn their [A]heads to the city [E]sun.
Jo'anna [A]give them the fancy [D]money,
Oh, to [A]tempt any[E]one who'd [A]come.

{V_6}
She even [A]knows how to swing o[D]pinion,
In every [A]magazine and the jour[E]nals,
For every [A]bad move that this Jo'[D]anna make,
They got a [A]good expla[E]nati[A]on.

{C}
Oh, gimme [A]hope, Jo'anna,
[D]Hope, Jo'anna,
Gimme [A]hope, Jo'anna,
'Fore the [E]morning come.
Gimme [A]hope, Jo'anna,

[A]Hope before the [E]morning [A]come.

{V_7}
Even the [A]preacher who works for [D]Jesus,
The Arch[A]bishop who's a peaceful [E]man,
Together [A]say that the freedom [D]fighters
Will [A]overcome the [E]very [A]strong.

{V_8}
I wanna [A]know if you're blind Jo'[D]anna,
If you [A]wanna hear the sound of [E]drum,
Can't you [A]see that the tide is [D]turning,
Oh, don't make me [A]wait 'till the [E]morning [A]come!

{C}
Oh, gimme [A]hope, Jo'anna,
