I'm [Fm]sitting here in the [Cm]boring room,
It's [Fm]just another rainy Sunday [Cm]afternoon,
I'm [Fm]wasting my time, I got [Cm]nothing to do,
I'm [Fm]hanging around, I'm [Cm]waiting for you,
But [A#m]nothing ever happens[Cm] and I [Fm]wonder.   [Cm]    [Fm]    [-]

{V_2}
I'm [Fm]driving around [Cm]in my car,
I'm [Fm]driving too fast, I'm [Cm]driving too far.
I'd [Fm]like to change my [Cm]point of view,
I [Fm]feel so lonely, I'm [Cm]waiting for you,
But [A#m]nothing ever happens[Cm] and I [Fm]wonder.   [Cm]    [Fm]

I [Ab]wonder how, I [D#]wonder why,
[Fm]Yesterday you told me 'bout the [Cm]blue blue sky,
And [Db]all that I can [D#]see is just a yellow [Ab]lemon-tree. [D#]
I'm [Ab]turning my head [D#]up and down,
I'm [Fm]turning, turning, turning, turning, [Cm]turning around,
And [Db]all that I can [Bb7]see is just another [D#]lemon-tree.

I'm [Fm]sitting here, I [Cm]miss the power.
I'd [Fm]like to go out, [Cm]taking a shower,
But [Fm]there's a heavy cloud in[Cm]side my head,
I [Fm]feel so tired, put my[Cm]self into bed,
While [A#m]nothing ever happens[Cm] and I [Fm]wonder.   [Cm]    [Fm]

[A#m]Isolation [Fm]is not good for me.
[D#]Isolation, [Ab]I don't want to [Cm]sit on the lemon-tree.

{V_4}
I'm [Fm]steppin' around in the [Cm]desert of joy,
[Fm]Baby anyhow I'll get a[Cm]nother toy,
And [A#m]everything will happen,[Cm] and you [Fm]wonder.   [Cm]    [Fm]

And I [D#]wonder, wonder,
