		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>By downloading and using Campfire, these terms will automatically apply to you - therefore you should make sure that you read them carefully.</p>
		<p>This application is provided to you by Pandula Péter at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
		<h2>General overview</h2>
		<p>This page is used to inform you regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decided to use my service.</p>
		<p>If you choose to use my service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The personal information that I collect is used for providing and improving the service and you can opt out of this collection at any time. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible in the Campfire app, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<h2>Information collection and use</h2>
		<p>I am doing my best to allow you to opt out from data collection. I'm only using the following third-party services that can collect your data and you are given the option to disable either or both of them in the application. Click on the links to read about their respective policies:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Firebase Analytics</a> for anonimously tracking the way the application is used so that I can improve the popular parts and retire the unpopular ones. This includes timestamped logs of the various actions people can perform in the app (like opening a songs or navigating between the different screens) as well as your system configuration like language, device type and country.</li>
			<li><a href="http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a> for logging any possible errors so that I can quickly fix them in a future update. This includes system logs at the moment of the crash as well as details about your device's hardware (processor, screen, manufacturer) and software (Android version, ammount of free memory, etc).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Even if you enable data collection to help in the development, I'm not collecting any personally identifiable information on purpose. However, keep in mind that some data collection mechanisms are beyond my control. For instance, just by downloading the application from the Google Play Store, you are automatically sharing some limited usage data and crash logs with me, the developer as well as Google. You agreed to this when accepting the Play Services license agreement, over which I have no control whatsoever.</p>
		<h2>Security</h2>
		<p> I value your trust in providing me your personal information, thus I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
		<h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
		<p>These services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.</p>
		<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p> I may update my Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>
		<h2>Contact me</h2>
		<p>If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:pandulapeter@gmail.com?Subject=Campfire" target="_top">contact me</a>.</p>
