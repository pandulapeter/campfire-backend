		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>Pandula Péter built Campfire as an open-source application. This Service is provided by Pandula Péter at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
		<p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.</p>
		<p>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service and you can opt out of this collection at any time. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible in the Campfire app unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
		<p>I did my best to allow you to opt out from data collection. I'm only using the following third-party services that can collect your data and you are given the option to disable either or both of them. Click on the links to read about their policies:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Firebase Analytics</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf" target="_blank">Crashlytics</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Even if you enable data collection to help in the development, I'm not collecting any personally identifiable information on purpose. However, keep in mind that some data collection mechanisms are beyond my control. For instance, just by downloading the application from the Google Play Store, you are automatically sharing some limited usage data and crash report logs with me, the developer as well as Google. You agreed to this when accepting the Play Services license agreement, over which I have no control.</p>
		<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
		<p> I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>
		<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
		<p> I value your trust in providing me your Personal Information, thus I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
		<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
		<p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
		<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
		<p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.</p>
		<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
		<p> I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
